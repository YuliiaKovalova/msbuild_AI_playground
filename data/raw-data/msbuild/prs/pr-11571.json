          "message": "Remove deprecated 4.3.* package references\n\nBoth \"System.Runtime\" and \"System.Private.Uri\" are inbox in .NETCoreApp since ~2017 and don't need to be referenced explicitly anymore.\n\nThey were referenced here as external dependencies brought vulnerable netstandard1.x dependencies in which were then flagged by CG.\n\nThat isn't the case anymore. xunit, shouldly and other packages with their corresponding versions used in this repo don't bring netstandard1.x in anymore.\n\nDon't reference \"System.Net.Http\" for the same reason. It is inbox on .NET Framework, .NETCoreApp and .NET Standard. On .NET Framework a \"<Reference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" />\" item is needed as it isn't part of the default referenced assemblies.\n\nNote that this change will help when starting to consume a .NET 10 SDK as those would get flagged by NuGet Prune Package Reference and NuGet Audit.",

We were missing the entry for System.Text.Encoding.CodePages in Version.Details.xml which caused a prebuild in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/47377.\n\nAlso simplified the way we reference the different package versions a bit to make it clearer.\n\nRemove Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence from SourceBuildPrebuiltBaseline.xml, since we now properly reference it from source-build-externals",
