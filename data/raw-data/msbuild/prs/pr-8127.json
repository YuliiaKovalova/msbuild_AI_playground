  "title": "Remove Bootstrap Property from Onboarding Docs",
  "body": "# Mostly Wholistic Summary\r\n- Forgind made a PR where the bootstrap flag is set automatically when building which simplifies the dev process a lot.\r\n- Some of the documentation wasn't changed when that got merged in and we didn't notice until onboarding a new teammate \r\n\r\nSo, this PR does the following:\r\n- Change all of the inferences to bootstrap except on bootstrapped_msbuild.sh files, though it's likely also not needed there\r\n- Also mention installing the SDK as installing workloads may not get the needed ASP.NET Runtime Packs for 7.0\r\n- Also fixes a typo lol\r\n\r\n# Further Context\r\nFollow up to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7485 \r\n\r\n@rainersigwald  @edvilme If there were additional things you needed to do to resolve the failures, we should add them to this PR.\r\n\r\ncc @Forgind ",
