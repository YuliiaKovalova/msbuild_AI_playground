  "body": "This reverts commit 74e9935a4a2e0108343533b3445516ad111e87ea.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\ndotnet/project-system#7432 added a design-time target called CollectSuggestedWorkloads to [Microsoft.Managed.DesignTime.targets](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/main/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Managed/ProjectSystem/DesignTimeTargets/Microsoft.Managed.DesignTime.targets). However, WAP projects do not import the managed design-time targets so their design-time builds fail because the CollectSuggestedWorkloads design-time target cannot be found (see dotnet/project-system#7561).\r\n\r\n#6813 worked around this by defining dummy targets in Microsoft.Common.props. This change cleans up that work-around by removing the dummy design-time targets.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nReverted #6813\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n1. Opened a solution that uses global.json to pin to .NET 5 (VS.RPC.Contracts) and verified that design-time builds succeeded and no errors are displayed in the error list\r\n2. Create a new Windows Application Packaging Project and verified that design-time builds will fail as expected without this workaround\r\n3. Opened a MAUI solution and verified that the suggested workloads are still correctly displayed to the user.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nMoving these dummy targets out of the props file into Microsoft.Common.targets would override the real target needed by the project system because [Microsoft.Managed.DesignTime.targets](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/main/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Managed/ProjectSystem/DesignTimeTargets/Microsoft.Managed.DesignTime.targets) is [imported before Microsoft.Common.targets](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.CSharp.CurrentVersion.targets#L326)\r\n\r\nThe WAP project system should therefore define these targets in an appropriate import file they own.",
