  "body": "This pull request fixes: #4836\r\n\r\nChanges introduced in this delivery extends the *MSB5009* with additional information about the incorrectly nested project within the solution. Additional details are:\r\n* incorrectly nested project's name (without the full path, unique name only),\r\n* incorrectly nested project's GUID\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** original *MSB5009* error is kept in the resources for backward compatibility (see commit messages) while the extended MSB5009 can be easily invoked with extended name.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nChanges done in this delivery are:\r\n* Create additional version of *MSB5009* error with modified error message - meaning stays the same as original *MSB5009* error, but incorrectly nested project's name and GUID is added as arguments.\r\n* Replace the old *MSB5009* with the extended one for each place where this extended error should be used.\r\nNOTE: `SolutionFile.ParseNestedProjects()` method has the original error kept, as it does specify at least the line of the solution file with the incorrect project. Moreover, at the moment of throwing the error, there's no possibility of getting the name of the project.\r\n* Cover the incorrect nesting case with the unit test checking whether for an original reproduction solution (please check the commit message for link) proper error with both name and GUID is thrown.\r\n\r\nFor more details about each change please see the commit message.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExample\r\nof original *MSB5009* error vs the extended version presented below. For both cases the same solution file was used, which is the solution file mentioned before available to get from the original [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4835).\r\n\r\nThe original error:\r\n![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70535775/97195157-4b978600-17ab-11eb-93d1-5297cc553360.png)\r\nThe extended version (the results of this following PR):\r\n![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70535775/97195649-e1cbac00-17ab-11eb-9c68-a34bee728c3e.png)\r\n\r\n",
