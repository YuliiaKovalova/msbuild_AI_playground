  "body": "Based off of https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6891#issuecomment-938021568\r\n\r\n@rokonec, I tried testing this, but the numbers I came up with weren't terribly promising. I only looked at first run after clean with no processes running, since I thought that would give a fair but positive view, and it seemed to make building OrchardCore slightly slower. I know it would be better if I could avoid creating two SystemStates whenever I decide I do need to deserialize a statefile, but that should be relatively minor; is there anything obvious I did wrong with this implementation? If it looks as you'd expected, we might have to scrap this idea.",
