  "body": "### Enable Change Waves\r\nProvide customers with the ability to _opt out_ of potentially breaking changes. This effectively warns them that there is a breaking change coming and gives them time to prepare for it.\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n- [x] Reach out to Kathleen and get approval on using `MSBuildDisableFeaturesFromVersion`\r\n- [x] Rename intrinsic function to `AreFeaturesEnabled`\r\n- [x] If `MSBuildDisableFeaturesFromVersion` is set to a value higher than the current highest change wave, clamp it to the current highest change wave.\r\n- [x] If `MSBuildDisableFeaturesFromVersion` is set to a value within the bounds of versions, but not set to a specific wave, set `MSBuildDisableFeaturesFromVersion` to the next highest wave.\r\n- [ ] Have the build manager throw warnings as necessary in `BeginBuild` [Warnings are logged but not visible in logs or output window?]",
