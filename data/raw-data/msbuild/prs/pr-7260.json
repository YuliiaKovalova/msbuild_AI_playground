  "body": "Fixes #3141\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n#5144 ensured TaskHost processes died after a build was complete. That didn't affect whether they could be reused within a single build. We do not want them to be reused within a build, so this prevents intra-build node reuse with TaskHosts unless the user requests it via escape hatch.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nPrevent TaskHosts from even looking for old TaskHosts unless the user says it's ok.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdjusted a test. It failed. Now it passes.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",

Thank you!\r\n\r\nI should have marked this as a draft\u2014sorry about that. Some internal people were starting multiple builds concurrently on the same machine and seeing a TaskHost made by one build then be reused by another, which was causing trouble. rainersigwald expressed concerns over the performance impact of this change, and I looked into it a bit more with him, and we couldn't get it to repro locally, so we're planning to see if our mitigation suggestions worked. We'll probably end up closing this afterwards.",
