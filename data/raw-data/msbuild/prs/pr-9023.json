          "message": "Avoid boxing when enumerating project xml children\n\nIn a recent profile of a graph construction, it was observed that a\nlarge amount of boxing was happening for\nProjectElementSiblingEnumerable. This change simplifies how xml children\nare enumerated by adding an internal ChildrenEnumerable property which\ndirectly exposes the ProjectElementSiblingEnumerable which should avoid\nboxing, at least in some code paths (the public API makes it hard to\navoid everywhere...).\n\nAdditionally, a very common usage of enumerating children was to do\nChildren.OfType<T> and wrap it in a ReadOnlyCollection<T>, so I\nintroduced a GetChildrenOfType (and GetChildrenReversedOfType) method\nwhich exposes an ICollection<T> which does the same thing but without\nthe boxing of ProjectElementSiblingEnumerable and without the OfType\nclass. It's just 1 collection allocation.",

This is\nproblematic as some projects are outside of the scope of the solution\nbut still have certain targets that run on them that are architecture\nspecific. These projects will build as the wrong architecture because no\nconfiguration is defined and no platform negotiation takes place.\n\nI removed the conditional that turns platform negotiation off on a sln\nlevel. The logic to turn this off on a project level is already in place\nthrough checking is a projectreference has setplatform appended to it.\nThis will make sure no projects with configurations defined will be\nnegotiated for as MSbuild adds setplatform metadata to projectreferences\nwith configurations.",
