  "body": "Fixes #8039\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.NET.StringTools currently contains a netstandard2.0 ref assembly but no matching implementation assembly. This causes a run-time bind failure when the library is used by a 3.1 app, for example.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe package is being picked up MessagePack which targets netstandard2.0. The issue [blocks it from updating to a newer version of the library](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/pull/1515).\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, this regressed in 17.3.0. Only the initial version of the package was correct.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nBuilt the package locally and inspected its contents.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis pull request uses a [documented workaround](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#advanced-extension-points-to-create-customized-package).\r\n\r\nPackage contents without the fix:\r\n```\r\n/lib\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n/ref\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n    netstandard2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nPackage contents with the fix:\r\n```\r\n/lib\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n    netstandard2.0\r\n/ref\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n    netstandard2.0\r\n```",

I realize, now that it's been pointed out).",
