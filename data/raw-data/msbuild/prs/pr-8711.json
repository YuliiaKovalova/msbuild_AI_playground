Loosely related discussion on allowing community translations: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/27257 \r\nThe story around fixing the official transaltion is similar - this is currently not possible.\r\n\r\nThe translations are done by separate team and 'flown' automatically into subscribed repositories - any custom changes would be overwritten on next sync (see: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pulls?q=is%3Apr+%22Localized+file+check-in+by+OneLocBuild%22)\r\n\r\nThe only way how to initiate translation change is to file a bug with localization team:\r\n* [Internal only link - bug template] https://aka.ms/icxLocBug\r\n* [Internal only link - feedback form] https://aka.ms/localizationfeedback \r\n* [External - feedback form] https://aka.ms/provide-feedback\r\n\r\nThe bar for reflecting those submissions is however currently very high - it's not guaranteed that pure translation or/and formatting issues will be reflected (beyond functional/legal/offensive concerns - which take priority)\r\n",
