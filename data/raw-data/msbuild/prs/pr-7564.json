  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4584.\n\n### Context\n\nThe existing code assumes that the presence of NativeReference items means\nthat there will be native manifests (such as WindowsApplication1.exe.manifest).\nThis is an invalid assumption, because NativeReference items are used for\nother project types, in particular a certain type of Xamarin.iOS projects,\nand in those cases there won't be any manifest files.\n\nThe end result is that the build (pack) fails because it tries to include a\nmanifest file that doesn't exist.\n\n### Changes Made\n\nOnly include manifest files as built output if the manifest files exist.\n\n### Testing\n\nI modified my local installation and the build (pack) worked just fine.\n\n### Notes",
