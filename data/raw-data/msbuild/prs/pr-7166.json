  "body": "Fixes #3784 and Updates #7008\r\n\r\nFollow-ups from\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7008#pullrequestreview-836812544\r\n2. https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22719#discussion_r773444947\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nFor multi-level properties, follow the naming pattern similar to `BaseProperty_SubOption` with an `_`\r\nunderscore character acting as a separator to make these properties clearer. We already follow this\r\npattern in Common props where we have `DisableLogTaskParameter_ConvertToAbsolutePath_Path`and friends.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/14313d17e407e24ad80e113bd475d1dd7c698656/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.props#L181-L183\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nSo, Use `AssemblySearchPath_Use{Variant}` property format to control individual inclusion of different\r\nvariants of assembly search paths. By default, these properties will be opt-out to maintain back-compat.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis change hasn't been shipped yet. So, it's technically not breaking and it's also not too late to change it.\r\nI have changed all the references in targets, docs and schema. Let me know if there are any other places I should change.",
