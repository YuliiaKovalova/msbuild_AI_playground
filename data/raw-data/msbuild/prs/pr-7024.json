  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThe `CopyToOutputDirectory` property only supports values `Never`, `Always` or `PreserveNewest`.\r\n\r\nMSBuild provides an XSD file that drives IntelliSense in VS when editing project XML.\r\n\r\nEarlier today we were debugging a broken incremental build related to the use of `Always`. It wasn't obvious what the correct value should be, as no IntelliSense was provided in VS.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nThis change allows VS and other consumers of the XSD to suggest and validate that the provided value is valid.\r\n\r\nThe property on some item types was previously declared incorrectly as being a boolean.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n",

However metadata may also be specified as XML attributes on the item's element. This is a common pattern, especially when hand editing.\n\nHere we add schema items for the CopyToOutputDirectory metadata. We could extend this to other metadata values.",

If I copy that XML to those elements which are not documented and update the loc ID, are there any other changes required to have those strings generate correctly?\r\n2. This change only works with _element_ metadata, not _attribute_ metadata. That is, we'll complete this:\r\n   ```xml\r\n   <None Include=\"Foo\">\r\n     <CopyToOutputDirectory>|</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n   </None>\r\n   ```\r\n   ...but not this:\r\n   ```xml\r\n   <None Include=\"Foo\" CopyToOutputDirectory=\"|\" />\r\n   ```\r\n   The same is true for other properties such as `Link`, `Visible`, and so forth. Do we want to copy these elements so that they are also available as attributes?",
