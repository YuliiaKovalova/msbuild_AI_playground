We could update to `17.5.0-previewXXXXX`, and I proposed doing that in [#8116 (comment)](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8116#discussion_r1049775959).\r\n\r\nGood point. Is there any reason it's better to update to 17.5-preview now, as opposed to just waiting until 17.5.0 is available? It would protect us if we change an API we'd just added, but it seems ok to me to have our errors for that be slightly delayed.",
