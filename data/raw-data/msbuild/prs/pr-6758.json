  "body": "Fixes #6067\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThere is a few dozen milliseconds worth of avoidable JITting happening in MSBuild assemblies on VS solution open. The respective methods are considered cold and not part of our NGEN images because they are not executed by current training scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nAdded an additional scenario to specifically cover .NET Core projects.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRan the OptProf pipeline with this change and then Perf.DDRITs with a build optimized using the resulting optimization data.\r\n\r\n- 50 ms less CPU spent JITting Microsoft.Build!*\r\n- Perf.DDRITs showing improvements:\r\n  - WebToolsVS64.SolutionManagement 0100.Open Solution - devenv methods JITted down by 24.4%\r\n  - WebToolsVS64.SolutionManagement 0200.Rebuild Solution - non-devenv methods JITted down by 4.5%\r\n  - ManagedLangsVS64.RebuildSolution 0100.Rebuild Solution - non-devenv methods JITted down by 12.1%\r\n  - CPlusPlusVS64.SolutionManagement 0300.Change Solution Configuration - Cold - devenv methods JITted down by 2.1%\r\n  - A few RefSet counters improved by a bit as well.\r\n- Impact on native image size is +490 kB  (+4 %).\r\n",

        "body": "> I see it's called OpenClose test. Do we have a scenario covering a basic build of this project type?\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, no. I wasn't able to find one that we could just reference. I think it would make perfect sense to add it as well (under src\\Tests\\MSBuild in the VS repo, for example). Another potential change I'm tracking is making our assemblies use full (as opposed to partial) NGEN, so even code that's not covered in training scenarios is pre-compiled.\r\n\r\n> Sounds like a nice win. Is there somewhere I can look at the solution?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely, the test uses this asset: [internal link](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_git/VS?path=%2Fsrc%2FTests%2FMicrosoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.DDRIT%2FAssets%2FProjectSystemOpenClose&_a=contents&version=GBmain).",
