  "body": "The big refactoring is making ProjectElementContainer have a set of Lists of different types of children, lazily initialized and semi-lazily kept sorted. Its children are often accessed using Children.OfType<...> now, and that would eliminate numerous passes over that LinkedList in addition to numerous conversions. Although these methods are called very often, the total number of Children turned out to be surprisingly small, generally under 50 and often under 10, so although there is still a win here, it might be with an undesirable complexity cost, especially since I couldn't make a single object (e.g., Dictionary) that could store all the lists without needing individual conversions afterwards, so the lists would still have to be remade unless I want one list per type.",
