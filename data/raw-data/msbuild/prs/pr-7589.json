  "body": "Today, if you want to run an `AppDomainIsolatedTask` in `dotnet build`, it fails\r\nbecause `AppDomainIsolatedTask` can't be identified. With this change, a user\r\ncan make the attempt to run the task, for instance with TaskHost isolation\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nThis was extra silly, because the main thing `AppDomainIsolatedTask` does is\r\napply the `[LoadInSeparateAppDomain]` attribute, which _was_ already working in\r\n.NET Core MSBuild.\r\n\r\nThis came up internally when someone was trying to run an old task that didn't\r\nappear to really need the AppDomain.
