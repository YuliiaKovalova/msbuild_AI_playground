  "title": "Remove SolutionFilterName support",
  "body": "We decided that adding support for a SolutionFilterName property was premature. The point of a solution filter is to permit loading or building only a subset of a more complicated solution file. Of note, however, it is not to permit changing behavior based on which subset is being built\u2014if a full solution is buildable, any associated solution filter file should be as well. Furthermore, if that information is not properly propagated within Visual Studio, it may lead to different behavior when building from the command line versus Visual Studio.",
