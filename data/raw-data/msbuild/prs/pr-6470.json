  "body": "Fixes #5955 \r\n\r\nI thought we had done something like this previously, but I don't see that we did. If this is bad, we can just close this.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nSystem.Memory 4.5.3 and System.Memory 4.5.4 both correspond to 4-part version 4.0.1.1, which is problematic when it comes to the GAC that receives a request for System.Memory 4.0.1.1 and may return the wrong one. These two versions have different dependencies as well, which can result in FileNotFoundExceptions. This may affect non-MSBuild applications, so it may be a bad idea, but it may also resolve issues like https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_queries/edit/1250432/?triage=true that refer to missing files.",
