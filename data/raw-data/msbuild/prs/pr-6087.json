I erroneously assumed that `Microsoft.Build.CPPTasks.Common` is inserted into VS and so the C++ team must first have a successful insertion after updating their branding before we can go in. That doesn't seem to be true, `Microsoft.Build.CPPTasks.Common` is built in the VS repo and we were simply too early.",
