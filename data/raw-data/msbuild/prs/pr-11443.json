  "body": "Fixes https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1980399/\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nMSBuild has custom xml parsing logic that is trying to distinguish whether the element content should be treated as regular xml element content (`XmlNode.InnerText`) or whether we want to allow users to pass in the actual unescaped xml (`XmlNode.InnerXml`)\r\n\r\nThe second option feels as not very good choice (allowing to specify xml recognized sequences within xml script, without properly escaping them) - but since it is already preexisting behavior, let's keep it.\r\n\r\nThe recgnition of CData section was inefficient and defective - not allowing leading whitespaces - so I've fixed at least that one\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nCData recognition now skips the leading whitespaces.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManual testing - loaded the repro project from the case into VS with and without fix and verified this is fixing the issue\r\n",
