        "body": "I'm working on this.  It's failing because the workload resolver doesn't work in the bootstrapped version of .NET Core MSBuild.  I tried adding the resolver files, but then the resolver crashes because the layout of the bootstrap folder isn't what it expects.  It expects the folder name that the resolver DLL is in to be the SDK version, and in the bootstrap layout it is \"MSBuild\".  Even if we worked around that, it looks for workload manifests in a relative path to the DLL.\r\n\r\nSo for now I think we should disable the workload resolver.  We can do that by putting a `DisableWorkloadResolver.sentinel` file in the MSBuild folder.\r\n\r\nHowever, once I do that I still get failures that the CreateAppHost task can't load Microsoft.NET.HostModel.  I'm not sure yet why this is happening.",
