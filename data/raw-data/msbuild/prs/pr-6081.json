  "title": "Fix deploy-MSBuild after arcade change",
  "body": "Arcade change didn't take into account Deploy-MSBuild, and it failed with a Microsoft.NET.StringTools.dll does not exist error. That was actually very fortunate (thanks ladipro!) since it otherwise would have silently accepted looking into the wrong folder (from a previous bootstrap build) and deploying something that hadn't actually been updated, which would have been extremely confusing.\r\n\r\nThis only fixes the instance I found, but I would recommend someone look for other similar instances.\r\n\r\nAlso, assuming this is eventually merged, @BenVillalobos for awareness, since it would have to be reverted also if we revert the arcade change.",
