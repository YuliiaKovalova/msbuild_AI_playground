  "body": "Fixes #\r\nhttps://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/MSB3179:-Problem-isolating-COM-reference/1571958\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nCustomer projects that reference a x86 COM binary cannot publish their project using ClickOnce provider.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nYes (Dev16 -> Dev17)\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nClickOnce's msbuild task to generate the application manifest has code that imports COM Component by reading their registration data from the registry. In this scenario, the COM reference is an x86 binary that is registered under HKCR\\WOW6432Node\\Clsid node. In dev17 with msbuild being an x64  process, the code is not reading from the WOW6432Node.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to update the code that's reads COM registration data to look under the WOW6432 node of HKCR as well.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nVerifed with customer provided repro project that x86 COM component is imported fine after the fix.\r\nCTI team has run regression tests and signed off on the private.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow. The check to read from the WOW6432 node is a fallback when we cannot get registration info from the non-WOW location. \r\n",
