This change is a straight revert of the PR that introduced the regression.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe bug makes it harder to diagnose MSBuild issues internally and externally. Note that Microsoft-Build ETW events are recorded by the VS Feedback tool, for example.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, introduced in #7139 on Dec 22nd 2021.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nVery low.\r\n\r\n### Is there a packaging impact?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Does the change affect files included in any ref pack (Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref, Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.Ref)?\r\n\r\nNo.",
