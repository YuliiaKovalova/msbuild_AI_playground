That's not appropriate here: before release we've broken the two repos closest to us, so we know it's breaky.\r\n\r\nOpt-ins are for behavior that is like this: breaky but also \"clearly right\". Then we can have the SDK opt in in new .NET versions or apply BuildChecks to encourage people to opt into stuff.\r\n\r\nOpt-outs without changewaves _used_ to be how almost everything was done (which is why we have so many) but now we prefer changewaves (which go away eventually, leaving less ugly code). However, if we expect people to reasonably want differing behavior in different circumstances they can be reasonable.",
