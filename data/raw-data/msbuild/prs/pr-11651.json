It is inbox on .NET Framework, .NETCoreApp and .NET Standard. On .NET Framework a \"<Reference Include=\"System.Net.Http\" />\" item is needed as it isn't part of the default referenced assemblies.\n\nNote that this change will help when starting to consume a .NET 10 SDK as those would get flagged by NuGet Prune Package Reference and NuGet Audit.\n\n* Avoid netstandard1.x dependencies\n\n* fix build\n\n* Fix entries in Version.Details.xml and make version overriding clearer (#11561)\n\nFollow-up to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11145. We were missing the entry for System.Text.Encoding.CodePages in Version.Details.xml which caused a prebuild in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/47377.\n\nAlso simplified the way we reference the different package versions a bit to make it clearer.\n\nRemove Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence from SourceBuildPrebuiltBaseline.xml, since we now properly reference it from source-build-externals\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Viktor Hofer <viktor.hofer@microsoft.com>\nCo-authored-by: Alexander K\u00f6plinger <alex.koeplinger@outlook.com>",
