  "body": "Fixes #8313\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nSome of the unit tests are failing when run from VS - caused by the fact that those tests are supposed to execute msbuild and fail to do so due to attempts to interpret the test runner as the dotnet host process\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdded helper to infer the proper host to run the msbuild in core\r\nLogic adopted from [SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Resolvers/Microsoft.DotNet.NativeWrapper/EnvironmentProvider.cs#L65-L94), with some alternations (removed unnecessary interop, added nullables, some styling fixes)\r\n\r\n",

That includes test assemblies. However, the reasons for doing this in non-test assemblies (they aren't great reasons but they are reasons) don't really apply for test, so we introduced a shared assembly for test stuff to build that sort of thing once--but didn't move everything.",
