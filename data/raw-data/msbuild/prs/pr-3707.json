AFAIU we need redirects for all our redistributed dlls indifferent of VS to make it easy for tasks sharing these dependencies. But when VS also takes a dependency to one of these we need to then follow VS.\r\n\r\nOne risk is when we have a redirect to a version, and then VS comes along and adds a dependency and redirect to an older version. This is when we'd have to follow VS and downgrade, which is a small breaking change for tasks depending on a version between VS and ours. But I think it's worth the risk as opposed to prematurely adding our redirects to devenv and thus eagerly increasing the surface of things we have to be manually aware of.",
