  "title": "SetPlatform Negotiation: No global properties during GetTargetFrameworks",
  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7760\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7511 figured out a better way to prevent over-evaluations when A(Platform=x86) -> B(Platform=x86, Platforms=x64,x86). It allowed setplatform negotiation to check \"would project B have built as what A is currently building as if we _didn't tell it anything_?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's a bug when passing a global property because `GetTargetFrameworks` passes `Platform` and `Configuration`, despite not needing to. This PR is an attempt at resolving this by no longer passing those properties, as well as undefining them.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nRemove additional properties during the `MSBuild` call to `GetTargetFrameworks`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nIt's possible we can't fix it this way, and instead we'll need to create **two** msbuild calls. One that's the standard but only gets called when `EnableDynamicPlatformResolution` is false, and the other that only gets called when `EnableDynamicPlatformResolution` is true.",
