  "body": "### Summary\r\nThe issue is related to the presence of disposable resource that wasn't cleaned up in time.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nAbsence of dispose causes \"warning MSB3026: Could not copy \"*.dll\". Beginning retry 1 in 1000ms. The process cannot access the file '*.dll' because it is being used by another process. The file is locked by: \"MSBuild.exe\" and it's presence breaks project building.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nYes, was introduced in scope of https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/9313/files#diff-0c7ff4eddab39e683e61e6f11011eac73dae76d2574999184b3c0e74f9c2fa10\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManual -the problem wasn't caught locally, but manual testing doesn't expose any side effects.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow, doesn't contain any changes in logic.\r\n",
