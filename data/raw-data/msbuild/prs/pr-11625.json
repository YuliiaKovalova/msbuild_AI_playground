  "body": "Fixes failures like https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build/results?buildId=991991&view=results\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nWhen MSBuild is being built in the VMR, sometimes later-built packages can end up with different versions than earlier-built packages. That's not good, but it doesn't cause failures.\r\n\r\nHowever, these later-built packages can have different (higher) versions of dependency projects that had already been built with the lower versions. This causes downgrade failures like the following intermittently for any VMR jobs triggered around the end of the PST workday:\r\n\r\n> Detected package downgrade: Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core from 17.15.0-ci-25175-01 to centrally defined 17.15.0-ci-25174-01. Update the centrally managed package version to a higher version. \r\n> Msbuild.Tests.Utilities -> Microsoft.Build.Runtime 17.15.0-ci-25174-01 -> Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core (>= 17.15.0-ci-25175-01) \r\n> Msbuild.Tests.Utilities -> Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core (>= 17.15.0-ci-25174-01)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nDon't build MSBuild with shipping versions in the VMR unless the VMR passes an official build ID.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nLocal validation\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis needs to be in the VMR before we switch to flat flow as after that switch, we'll move source-build to use the same versioning rules as unified-build and they'll start getting destabilized in the same way.",
