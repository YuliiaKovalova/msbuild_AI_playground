  "title": "Fix bug in CacheSerialization.SerializeCaches",
  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThe method `CacheSerialization.SerializeCaches` was using `File.OpenWrite(fullPath)` which is pretty confusing if a file already exists, as it will write to it without truncating it. So if a cache file was 10MB and we then write a file that is just 5KB, the file will still be 10MB.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Use `FileStream` constructor instead with a more adequate behavior.",
