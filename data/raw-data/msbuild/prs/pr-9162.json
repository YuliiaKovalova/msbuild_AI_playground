  "body": "Fixes #9133\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n`NoWarn` has become flaky in all build configurations and frequently not suppresing  given warnings as errors.\r\n\r\nDuring analysis I have found out our `LoggingService` is storing suppressed warning codes list by key which was weakly hashed with lots of possible collisions in expected input ranges.\r\n\r\nWhen any project finishes its Warning configuration is removed from `LogginService warnign configs dictionary`, if just finished project have had collision key it removed the \"other-guy\" data.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nChanged to compound key as `readonly record struct`. \r\n\r\nSince we have smallish numbers of warnings during build I do not believe it have measurable perf degradation.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- I have manually replied captured failing /bl to verify that there was indeed hash collision for this particular project warnings config key. \r\n- Existing PR gate\r\n- Local testing\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nEvery time junior developer have had come to me with possible root cause \"What if it is hash collision\" I hushed them with automatic \"Oh. please\".\r\nBut this time it really is hash collision :-)",
