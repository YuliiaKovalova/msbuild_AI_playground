  "title": "Cleanup: Delete Pair of TKey, TValue",
  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of introducing the type seems to have been silencing a legacy code analyzer rule. The rule does not exist anymore / has not been brought over to Roslyn (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/722) and it's now hurting performance, if anything. We seem to be using primarily instantiations where both `TKey` and `TValue` are reference types, which will pick up the `__Canon, __Canon` instantiation from the mscorlib native image. The rest is handled by IBC/OptProf.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nDeleted Pair<TKey, TValue> and its uses.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nExperimental insertion to confirm no regressions.\r\n",
