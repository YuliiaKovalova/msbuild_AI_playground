  "title": "Proposed rewording for error message when enumerating drive",
  "body": "I have a PR out to make use of the environment variable that leads to this message when you try to enumerate your drive.\r\n\r\nFrom the SDK's perspective, however, this message is a bit confusing because it talks about some specific ItemGroup, whereas the reality is probably that it came from some MSBuild code you didn't write, and the real problem is that you're building at the root of your drive.\r\n\r\nI think this wording is an improvement but not perfect. For instance, it isn't a problem if your current working directory is the drive root as long as you specify a project that isn't there, but I don't just want to say 'that your project isn't at the drive root' because if you try to build without specifying a project while at the drive root (as with `dotnet new`), it'll fail, and you'll be confused.\r\n\r\nThoughts? @baronfel ",
