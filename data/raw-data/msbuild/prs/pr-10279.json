          "message": "Add version to BuildResult 2 (#10288)\n\nFixes #10208\r\n\r\nContext\r\nWe are adding a version field to this class to make the ResultsCache backwards compatible with at least 2 previous releases (meaning the newer VS can read a cache created by older VS). The cache is not forwards compatible (older versions of VS cannot read cache created by newer versions). The adding of a version field is done without a breaking change in 3 steps, each separated with at least 1 intermediate release.\r\n\r\nExecution plan:\r\n\r\n1st step (done): Add a special key to the _savedEnvironmentVariables dictionary during the serialization. A workaround overload of the TranslateDictionary function is created to achieve it. The presence of this key will indicate that the version is serialized next. When serializing, add a key to the dictionary and serialize a version field. Do not actually save the special key to dictionary during the deserialization but read a version as a next field if it presents.\r\n\r\n2nd step: Stop serialize a special key with the dictionary _savedEnvironmentVariables using the TranslateDictionary function workaround overload. Always serialize and de-serialize the version field. Continue to deserialize _savedEnvironmentVariables with the TranslateDictionary function workaround overload in order not to deserialize dictionary with the special keys.\r\n\r\n3rd step: Stop using the TranslateDictionary function workaround overload during _savedEnvironmentVariables deserialization.\r\n\r\nChanges Made\r\n1st step from above description.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nUnit tests, manual tests, experimental insertion",
