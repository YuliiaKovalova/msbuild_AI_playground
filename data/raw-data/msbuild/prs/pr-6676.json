  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/17890; fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/54774\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n#6096 updated the ```XamlPreCompile``` target to be up to date with Roslyn to make sure source generators work for this target as well. However, it also enabled analyzers to run even though none of the targets such as ```CoreGenerateAssemblyInfo``` or ```_ComputeSkipAnalyzers``` are setup correctly to also run before ```XamlPreCompile```.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThis PR reverts parts of #6096 by setting SkipAnalyzers to true for the ```XamlPreCompile``` target but still pass in Analyzers so source generators continue to work.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nVerified that warnings from mentioned issues go away.\r\n",
