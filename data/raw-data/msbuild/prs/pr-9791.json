This causes either that VS to be used, or the 17.8.3 xcopy-msbuild.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the right solution is here. You can't rely on core msbuild for the build in all cases, due to generating TLBs in certain cases (and needing to finding the tlb tooling), but it's hard to predict which msbuild is going to get used in various CI/PR/Officail scenarios.",
