What would you suggest?\r\n\r\nThis *should* theoretically be safe, since no one would reasonably set this value to anything above this point in msbuild evaluation since it would be clobbered. But if they did anyway, then it no longer being clobbered could theoretically break something. Although it seems more likely that it would *fix* or guarantee target build order where it was broken before.\r\n",
