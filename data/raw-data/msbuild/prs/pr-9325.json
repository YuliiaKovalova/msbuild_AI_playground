Enough people have followed Internet Advice\u2122\ufe0f or run a script that GACs things that before we added the ungac-during-setup step, we got a steady stream of hard-to-debug issues that could be root-caused to MSBuild being in the GAC, so we wanted to try to fix those for users proactively--but not at the cost of reducing installer reliablity for everyone. It seemed to be working, but now this is one of the Setup team's top issues.",
