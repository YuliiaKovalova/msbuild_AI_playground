So\nMSBuild moved to alternative (secure) serialization. MSBuild normally\nallows users to opt out of the last batch of changes - with changewaves.\nIn this specific case it can mean shooting self into foot without\nrealizing.\n\nResolution: Ignoring the opt-out of the new secure serialization unless\nthe BinaryFormatter is explicitly allowed by user in runtime (by editing\n`MSBuild.runtimeconfig.json` in the SDK).",
