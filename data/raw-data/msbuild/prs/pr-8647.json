  "title": "Update NuGet packages to 6.5.0",
  "body": "This is a fairly low-pri but low-risk change. It updates from the RC packages to the GA ones.\r\n\r\nThe packages this applies to and their usages are:\r\n* `Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver` is used by `MSBuild.csproj` and the bootstrap. For `MSBuild.csproj` only grabs an XML file from it (which points to the `Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver.dll` binary \"2 directories up\"; the actual binary ships separately), and is identical to the previous version.\r\n* `NuGet.Build.Tasks` (and `NuGet.Build.Tasks.Console` once #8488 is merged) are only used in bootstrapping.\r\n* `NuGet.Frameworks` is only used in UTs (`Microsoft.Build.Engine.UnitTests.csproj`)",

If the latter I'm inclined to just wait.\r\n\r\nNope, no specific need. I actually want some fixes in 6.6.x, but those aren't publicly available, and I figured I'd do this minor cleanup while I was here.\r\n\r\nDidn't notice that the version for `Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver` is woefully behind on NuGet.org :(",
