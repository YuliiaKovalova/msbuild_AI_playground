  "body": "### Context\r\nMSBuild had been added to the code validation pipeline but was missing the tsa config file. Per the instructions [here](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/36ac84d30381886c6bad6cd55c28771dcc4c0880/Documentation/Validation.md?plain=1#L40-L47) and after talking to Matt, adding this file\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdded a tsa config file by copying from SDK\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNot sure how to test this. I pushed an internal build but the checks didn't run as I'm told they run nightly in a separate pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nValidation pipeline: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2157183&view=results",

I checked and nearly every other repo does set that flag to true (except for sdk and installer) so I went ahead and added it. I double checked with Matt and he suggested adding it as well.
