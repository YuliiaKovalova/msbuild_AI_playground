          "message": "Merged PR 423224: Update 16.7 build definition\n\nThis PR had two main parts: modernizing the .vsts-dotnet.yml file in our repo and upgrading arcade.\n\nFor the first, we had 4 main parts. This updated the pool we used for our build to be something that exists, switched to using a personal access token because our prior authentication method had been removed, stopped using a couple no-longer-functional azure devops tasks (opting for modern versions), and set our vm image to be one we have access to\u2014i.e., a modern one.\n\nFor the second, we waffled slightly on the arcade version to update to but ultimately switched to version 1.0.0-beta.21065.4 of arcade (6b9ad1b86345fb7fb81899b230fed387c611d55a). On top of that, we needed a slight tweak to the .net cli version, as we'd gotten off there.",

          "message": "Merged PR 413658: Focus temp path accesses to one spot\n\nOn Linux, the default /tmp folder is shared across all users and accessible by them. There are some cases in which we put sensitive information in temp and assume it's fine because on Windows, it is. This doesn't actually fix that assumption, since we're currently waiting for a new API that will be introduced in .NET 7 that will make a folder with appropriate permissions. However, this PR changes all the issues Eric Erhardt identified such that they go through a single code path, so to fix the security issue afterwards just requires changing the one place in our code.\n\nIt did occur to me that we may not be able to use that API, in which case I can just write something to make a folder with a random name under temp then tweak its permissions.",

For 16.7, we expanded its usage to include creating the \"file\" to be used by a unix socket. That file should not be created manually because it needs to be created a socket. With the assert, we noticed the socket-file and threw erroneously.",
