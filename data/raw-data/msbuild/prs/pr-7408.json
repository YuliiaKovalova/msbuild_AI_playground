  "title": "project cache plugin cancellation fix",
  "body": "Fixes #\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThe project cache plugin's Shutdown() method can be called multiple times when canceling a build with ctrl+c. Calling shutdown attempts to sets the plugin's state to **ShutdownStarted**. However, before setting the state, a check is done to ensure that the plugin's state is not currently **ShutdownStarted** or **ShutdownFinished**, and if so, throws an exception. If Shutdown() is called more than once, as it is when the build is canceled, one of these impermissible states will be set, and an exception will be thrown.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdds a check, in plugin's shutdown method, to determine if shutdown had been called previously, and aborts if so.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManual testing of ctrl+c, to ensure that issue is fixed\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
