  "body": "Implements a text-based performance log scheme that writes coarse-grained performance logs:\r\n\r\n - No logs are written unless the user opts-in by setting the log location via the environment variable `DOTNET_PERFLOG_DIR`.  This is currently enabled when a user opts-in via a CLI command, but can be set adhoc as well.\r\n - Most logs will be produced at the request of CLI commands.  The lifetime of these logs is managed by the CLI - see https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/14409 for details.\r\n - Data in the logs are emitted via `MSBuildEventSource` so that the events can be consumed through other profilers, such as those that use ETW.\r\n\r\ncc: @marcpopMSFT, @davidfowl, @DamianEdwards, @bwadswor",
