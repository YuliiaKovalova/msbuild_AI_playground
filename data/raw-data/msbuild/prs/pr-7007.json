  "title": "Stop loading Microsoft.DevDiv files as read-only",
  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nMSBuild currently loads all files whose name starts with `Microsoft.DevDiv` as read-only. It is breaking scenarios where such files are legitimately written to. It is unfortunate to use hard-codes names in general.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nRemoved the special handling.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nIdeally would verify that the Visual Studio repo builds fine with this change but it looks like too much hassle for such a safe change (famous last words).\r\n",
