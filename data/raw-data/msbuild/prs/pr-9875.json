Double-check that we run perf ddrits early when we change the assemblies we ship with (or the .swr in general).\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nUse resourceManagement policy to add a comment to remind the author of pull request that has the change to *.swr file.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
