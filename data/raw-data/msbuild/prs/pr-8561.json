  "body": "Summary\r\nOriginal implementation did not expect multiple instances of BuildManager called concurrently. But in VS DTB and normal build are run concurrently.\r\n\r\nThis is backported from main PR https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8444\r\n\r\nCustomer Impact\r\nIn rare cases Dictionary data structure is corrupted and can cause infinite loop. This affect only VS scenarios.\r\nIt is currently https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7 ranked VS hang issue.\r\n\r\nRegression?\r\nYes, introduced in VS 17.4.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nManual validation by @rokonec and automated tests. Additionally it has been in bleeding edge VS for about three weeks.\r\n\r\nRisk\r\nLow\r\n\r\nNote\r\nHas been already backported to 17.5\r\nContains fix for infra which disables nuget static graph restore (otherwise CI pipeline is failing)",
