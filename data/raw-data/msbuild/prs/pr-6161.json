If they do have, I'll create a separate PR for those.\r\nI'll also separate the commits by common refactors and have a last one or two commits containing everything else to make reviewing easier.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm placing this in Draft since there are many refactors to be added.\r\n\r\n**Please hold up your reviews until it's out of draft.**",
