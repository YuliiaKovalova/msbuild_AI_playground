  "body": "Fixes #TBA\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nMake Common props, targets and tasks easier to read and understand.\r\n\r\nThe Comments in Common props, targets and tasks doesn't have a clear format.\r\nAlso, some comments got messed up really bad that they appear next line to source instead of before.\r\nThus, I propose a simple comment style and format comments according to that.\r\n\r\nPart of the larger refactoring that'll lead into #1686\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nFixup the Comments across Common props, targets and tasks files\r\n\r\nEnsure they follow consistent formatting\r\n\r\nE.g.: 2-space indent\r\n```xml\r\n  <!-- Single Line Comment Text -->\r\n  <!--\r\n    Multi Line Comment Text\r\n    Another Comment Text\r\n\r\n    Title:\r\n      Indented Comment Text\r\n      Subtitle:\r\n        Indented Comment Text\r\n  -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n**NIL**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nI'll update the style patterns one by one as I do the formatting.\r\nI'll also separate the commits by comment style or by code block and/or by file to make reviewing easier.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm placing this in Draft since there are many comments to be formatted.\r\n\r\n**Please hold up your reviews until it's out of draft.**",
