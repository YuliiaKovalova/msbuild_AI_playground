  "body": "Since `ProcessStartInfo.Environment` is now available in all supported TFMs,\r\nthe feature flag is now just obsolete and even more so an unnecessary\r\ndifference between core and framework versions of MSBuild.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nFound this old feature flag to be obsolete while researching `ToolTask` behavior.\r\nThis was added during the original OSS porting work of MSBuild, when `ProcessStartInfo.Environment` was only available\r\nin .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nUse `ProcessStartInfo.Environment` for all flavors of MSBuild.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI don't think any additional testing code is needed - preexisting test suites cover this all pretty well and the change between `Environment` and `EnvironmentVariable` is only a change in type not an underlying change in behavior.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n1. EditorConfig enforced a couple of whitespace changes with `trim_trailing_whitespace`. I didn't remove these since that's supposed to happen at some point anyways. I hope that's ok.\r\n2. I didn't create an issue first since this is primarily a cosmetic change to reduce clutter and the change is relatively small - unified behavior between core and framework flavors only comes in second. Again, i hope that's cool with everyone \ud83d\ude05\r\n",
