  "body": "Fixes #\r\nSuggestion of new API for setting ProjectOptions on created `Project`\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nSetting EvaluationContext when working with `Project` is not optimal becuase of its interaction with the `ProjectCollection`.\r\nIf I create a `Project` with `ProjectOptions` I can get exception if im creating the same project multiple times, as the ProjectCollection will fail adding it to its internal lists.\r\nTo handle this best ive added a `LoadProjectWithOptions` on the ProjectCollection, as this will create it with the options if its not already created, making it possible to ie. setup EvaluationContext to Shared.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdded new method `ProjectCollection.LoadProjectWithOptions`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
