  "body": "Part 1/x to fix https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6472\r\n\r\nLet's reduce the energy required to keep up with some of the issues we get in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWe should be strict when it comes to cutting out issues that don't get responses from customers. This change closes out issues after ~1.5 months of inactivity that require the author of an issue to respond.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nCreated a github action to:\r\n1. Mark issues stale after 30 days of inactivity\r\n2. Close them two weeks after they've been marked stale\r\n3. To start, **this will only affect issues marked as \"Needs: Author Feedback\"**\r\n\r\n### For the dev team\r\nWhen you respond to github issues and need authors to respond, please apply \"Needs: Author Feedback\". We can figure out how to scale this over time, but starting with a small subset of issues is the right move.\r\n\r\nTo avoid a situation where customers are forced to [\"bump\" their issues](https://github.com/actions/stale/issues/288), remove \"Needs: Author Feedback\" from the issue.",

Once we're happy with it, we can update this PR to reflect the bot and get this merged in.\r\n\r\nSince you prefer to have minimal PR's I'll close this until either:\r\n\r\n1. We get fabric bot enabled, test it, and are happy with the setup\r\n2. We can't get it enabled after a week or two and we have no choice but to test through the GH action.\r\n3. Decide that fabric bot is good enough and not take the GH action until necessary (fabric bot service goes away or something)",
