The property is now missing any project to run - so likely rest of the configuration that it's serving is lost that way:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"785\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/3809076/d034e860-66aa-469f-a3b4-a21d65707851\">\r\n\r\nI haven't dug deeper into what exactly is the purpose of the property and what is skipped as the result of missing project - but hopefully you are equiped to carry on investigation based on the intent of the change\r\n",
