  "title": "Make sdk resolvers list immutable",
  "body": "Fixes #9679\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nUnder certain circumstances MSBuild will create and use multiple `SdkResolverService` classes, which leads to multiple read of sdk resolvers manifests files and re-loading of the resolvers. As stated in the issue, we should identify resolvers at most once in a process lifetime. \r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n`SdkResolverService` is supposed to be a singleton and is supposed to be instantiated only once. However, a derived class with caching `CachingSdkResolverService` was introduced. `CachingSdkResolverService` is not a singleton, thus allowing multiple loads of the resolvers. This PR makes `CachingSdkResolverService` a singleton, thus fixing multiple re-loads.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUnit tests, local testing and experimental insertion\r\n",
