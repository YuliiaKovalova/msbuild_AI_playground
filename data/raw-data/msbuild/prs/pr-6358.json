I noticed tests are failing because you need to run `build.cmd` and push up any newly generated files.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the fix will have to be a bit more involved. Removing the `[Required]` attribute will allow _value to be null, so the task will throw an exception as soon as it starts executing (see line ~96).\r\n\r\nThinking out loud:\r\nChanging behavior from \"this task throws if value is null\" to \"this task interprets null as empty\" sounds like a breaking change.\r\n\r\nMaybe we allow some extra metadata along with the task? Or do we take a step back and allow empty values for ITaskItems when building tasks?\r\n",

        "body": "Making a change for just this class is a lot less breaking than making a similar change for all classes. Also, I'm not convinced that letting the task not pass anything is a breaking change; no one can have code that uses null any differently because it isn't currently possible, and the only reason I can think of to want to pass an empty value to a task and wait for it to throw is if you're testing it, which no one but us should do.\r\n\r\nI do agree you'll have to properly account for null values, however. This can be done in the getter, the setter, or Execute. I'd prefer setter, personally, but any of those can work.",
