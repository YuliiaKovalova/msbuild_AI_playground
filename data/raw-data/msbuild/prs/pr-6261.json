  "body": "Fixes #6260 \r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThe evaluation result is being cached now on the CPS side to speed up solution load. For the cases where CPS has it's linked read-only Project, we would like to create a ProjectInstance as well from it, instead of triggering a evaluation for the sake of creating a ProjectInstance\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- Add a constructor to ProjectInstance that builds itself from the Project.\r\n- Also exposed the existing GetAllGlobs override to ProjectLink. Previously never exposed since ProjectLink was used only for csproj that does not really care about globs.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded a test for the new constructor.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe PR is triggered from my personal github account because @arkalyanms is locked out at the moment and is still in recovery.",
