  "title": "[WIP] Resurrect deprecated unit tests",
  "body": "This a draft pull request that tries to \"resurrect\" unit tests under `src\\Deprecated`: make them build and pass.\r\n\r\nThe fist commit here is a preview of what is to be done next: changing the projects to SDK-style ones, converting the unit tests to Xunit, fixing any bugs that crop up along the way.\r\n\r\nGiven the scale of the work and the status of the projects, I would very much appreciate the feedback on my approach here:\r\n1. While trying not to bring unnecessary dependencies, I do use the `Shared` files (instead of, for example, copy-pasting the necessary bits into the `Deprecated` folder). This is not desirable (makes \"freezing\" the projects impossible), but this is how the actual deprecated projects are set up right now.\r\n2. I do use explicit `Compile Include=\"\"`s for non-shared files. I would like to drop them, but this is also for consistency with the actual deprecated projects.\r\n3. I do convert the tests to Xunit instead of bringing in the original testing packages (MSTest and NUnit (so old it does not even exist on Nuget.org)).\r\n4. I do try and make the tests pass. This means changing code that should probably not be touched (for example, the one fix displayed here is the result of the fact that newer frameworks perform more stringent bounds checks in `StringBuilder`).\r\n\r\nIf this work is to be determined unnecessary and/or too risky, I would advocate for straight removal of these unit tests, as in their current state they are just a dead weight on the repository, unbuildable and unusable.\r\n\r\ncc @rainersigwald",

There is, however, a difference between actual source projects in that folder, which build and will presumably run somewhere somehow and unit tests, which are neither buildable nor runnable right now.
