  "body": "MSBuild's TaskHosts are intended for net35 compatibility. They aren't critical from a speed perspective, but we were attempting to ngen them anyway.\r\n\r\nThat ngen'ing happened in a 4.0.3319 environment\u2014far beyond the net35 compatibility it was intended for.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it failed. Then, when optprof tests attempted to run our tests, they failed to execute tasks...which expected to get the optimized task host...which meant that although we got _some_ optprof data, we didn't get any for our tasks assembly. This led to errors when we then tried to use those optprof dumps.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12969783/236926843-026bc7ef-c9f1-4c73-926b-35539b780d8d.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12969783/236927284-dfc8e729-abfc-4d1e-8310-1434dc828efb.png\">",

We shouldn't be running any of the new tasks from that assembly in a taskhost . . .\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% on this, but it seems like certain test scenarios start by ngen'ing TaskHost, fail, then give up without even trying to actually run the tests. Like if you look at the tests tab for [this build](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=7734521&view=results), you'll notice exactly one test failed. Then you click into why it failed, and the error is from a command line with ngen.exe. In other words, they wanted the ngen'd version of our task host because we said it was important, but then they failed to produce that and cut out early.",
