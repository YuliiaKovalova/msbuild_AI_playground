I saw that it failed to find 17.0, but the error message said \"The resource RoslynTools.MSBuild.17.0.nupkg...doesn't exist. Did you mean roslyntools.msbuild.17.0.0.nupkg?\", which made me think that 17.0.0 _does_ exist, in which case the important change here is from major.minor to major.minor.build, not from 17.0 to 17.2. If that's the case, 17.0.0 might work where 17.2 wouldn't.\r\n> \r\n> It ultimately doesn't matter too much, since 17.2.1 is known to work \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nAaaah - gotcha! Good point!\r\nWell - I'll reserve it as fallback :-) now trying with the setup that we have on vs17.4",
