  "body": "This is a workaround for https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/8393\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThis reverts the version of the Arcade SDK to work around a bug in the merged manifest generation that is merging the manifests with incorrect values, which breaks the publishing infrastructure.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nReverted to the last version of the Arcade SDK that doesn't have the problematic changes.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nRan this test build: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=5673773&view=results with this exact change, and then published that build to the testing channel: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=5673847&view=results. The publishing build created the isolated feeds that were expected. \r\n",
