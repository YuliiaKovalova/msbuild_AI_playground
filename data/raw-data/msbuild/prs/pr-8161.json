  "body": "### Context\r\nIn order to be able to collect optimization data for this branch using the opt-prof v2 pipeline, we need to update the runsettings file generation. The generation happens during the CI build. \r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- The `.runsettings` file was updated by using the custom template in the run settings generation task (instead using the default one). The default template used by the task is located [here](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/c5dd6a1da2e6d9b3423ab809fcda8af2927a408b/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk/tools/SdkTasks/VisualStudio.IbcTraining.runsettings). I took it and updated with the `VisualStudioConfiguration` element. This element derived from value `VSINSTALLATIONTYPE = optprof` from the legacy OptProf pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nExperimental run of the opt-prof v2.\r\n",
