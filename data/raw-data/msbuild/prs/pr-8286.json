NuGet is responsible for determining the set of supported target framework short names; the MSBuild code edited in this PR is a wrapper that exposes the NuGet functionality and shouldn't differ in behavior from calling the NuGet APIs directly. I'd suggest requesting the breaking change from NuGet, which I see you've done with NuGet/Home#12351, so I'm going to close this.",
