  "body": "Fixes  #11313\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nThe newly added `MSB3002` has a breaking potential (while it's very correct). So making it an opt-in behavior\r\n(\"MSB3002: Explicitly set culture \"{0}\" for item \"{1}\" was overwritten with inferred culture \"{2}\", because 'RespectAlreadyAssignedItemCulture' property was not set.\")\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nIf user took behavior on old incorrect behavior (explicitly set `Culture` metadata on EmbeddedResource were overwritten with culture inferred from the file extension) or they just don't care - they might be broken by the new warning that they might not appreciate.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nYes.\r\nThe warning was newly added (in 17.13)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTargetted test is testing the scenarios with explicit and implicit culture.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nMinimal (making the new warning opt-in).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
