  "title": "Sourcebuild 7.0: scoped ref for latest Roslyn",
  "body": "This change is required because of new C# features interacting with `ref` captures.\n\nPer @jaredpar:\n\n> How `ref` capture works is a core problem we've been struggling with in the `ref` field design. The initial design went too far into the \"let everything be captured\" space, that lead to a number of compat breaks so we tweaked on aspect severely in the other direction, and after more refinement ended up in a more explainable place. Essentially any `ref` can be captured in the return of the method or `out` parameters. In this case it's a ctor, it has a `ref` so that can be captured but you don't intend that here so `scoped` to tell us it can't happen.\n\nThis is required to remove a 7.0 sourcebuild patch.",
