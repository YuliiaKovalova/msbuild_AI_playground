  "body": "Fixes #5724\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdded UseUtf8Encoding parameter to ToolTask and removed it from Exec. Exec is a ToolTaskExtension, which is clearly an extension of ToolTask, but this may still count as a breaking change, in which case I could add it back to Exec with `new` to make it compile.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nMrTrillian tried this with a reduced repro solution, and it resolved the problem.",

I'll leave it as-is, just noting that anyone working on that will hopefully see it referenced here and draw inspiration from this PR.",
