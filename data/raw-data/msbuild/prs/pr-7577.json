Do MSBuild tests depend on PDBs being generated?\r\n\r\nIf not, LUT's build would probably be a bit faster with PDBs turned off. The only other downside of turning off PDBs is that you won't see clickable links for stack traces displayed in the LUT test window. But you could always debug the test reported as failing in LUT using the regular \"Debug Test\" command regardless of the above LUT setting.\r\n\r\nNote that turning PDBs on will also currently lead to some minor weirdness in the LUT test window. The stack traces displayed there will contain file paths from LUT's shadow workspace folder - so when you click on them this will open the corresponding files as Miscellaneous Files (as opposed to opening the corresponding files from your solution). We plan to fix the LUT test window to translate paths and open the files from the solution soon - but in the meanwhile you may want to watch out for this :)",
