  "title": "Fix wrong paths in SharedOutputPathAnalyzer.",
  "body": "Related to #10414\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nPR #10238 added normalization of the path (which includes getting full path) before [the project directory path is added to it](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/b381fcd79588b14ab2b6ab09cb57035d0336852f/src/Build/BuildCheck/Analyzers/SharedOutputPathAnalyzer.cs#L75). This led to the relative path being turned into a full path using CurrentDirectory instead of the project directory. This leads to enormous amount of false-positive analyzer's warnings (400 instead of 3) that cause the hang. This PR fixes the bug with paths and does not fix actual cause of a hang.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nReverted the PR #10238 and instead added normalization of the path later in the code when the project path is already combined with the relative path.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nunit tests and local runs",
