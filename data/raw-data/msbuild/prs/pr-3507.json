        "body": "Completely figured it out. So .NET Framework tests can't use the two ```App.config``` switches since the tests run on 4.6.1, and .NET Core tests will already have them enabled by default. Remember the switches are so we can target 4.6.1 but still use the new long path behavior when running on > 4.6.2.\r\n\r\nWhat makes it seem like ```App.config``` is being read: a bunch of tests on .NET Framework fail since they expect a ```PathTooLong``` exception that doesn't get thrown. But since most of the path-related calls on Windows net46 use native calls, it behaves as if the switches were set for many tests.\r\n\r\nWhich also means... if the remaining managed path-related calls went through ```FileUtilities```, ```FileSystems```, ect. where the conditional switches for native/managed calls are, long paths would actually work even when running on 4.6.1. And at that point the ```app.config``` switches wouldn't even be necessary. Would also make running tests with long paths enabled on 4.6.1 really easy since the behavior would be uniform, and not a mix of things that throw and don't throw ```LongPathException```. But that's a whole other issue.",
