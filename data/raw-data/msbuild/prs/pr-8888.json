        "body": "> I'll ask again: do we need anything else?\r\n\r\nSorry about the extra PR, that was my blunder as I missed a step while testing the change and this dependency slipped in. This should be the last one hopefully\r\n\r\nTo explain my reluctance to include more of similar dependencies unless absolutely needed - source-build product build will take every entry in `Version.Details.xml` and bump its version to latest. This does not create a major difference between product build and repository build as dependencies included in the file are mostly managed by automation (e.g. Darc) and are already upgraded to latest during development.\r\n\r\nWhen we are adding a pinned version to the `Version.Details.xml` we are creating a rift between the product build (which is using the latest version) and repository build (which is using the pinned version) in the source-build context. As such, if we do not need to we don't include extra pinned versions in `Version.Details.xml`\r\n",
