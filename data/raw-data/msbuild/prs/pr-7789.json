  "title": "Unrevert env change and fix timing issue found originally in ProjectSystemTools",
  "body": "### Context\r\nThe change to filtering environment variables caused a timing issue with project system tools in which it tried to read some properties then change the set of project properties, leading to a crash. This brings back the environment variable change but with a lock to prevent that issue.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nIntroduce a new method on PropertyDictionary to allow enumeration (and filtering) within a lock.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested a related change (but not this one) with the repro, and the problem did not recur. Will try testing this one specifically as well.\r\n\r\nEdit: Just tried with and without the second commit here. The issue reproduced without it but not with it.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
