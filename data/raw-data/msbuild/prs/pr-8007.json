You could either revert the changes in source files and reject this PR.\r\nb. Reject his pr, set the createPr as false in the build yaml and set it back to true once the branch is ready for loc updates\r\nc. Keep this PR opened. It will accumulate all localization changes to main in a single PR and you could just merge back once the branch is opened for changes again.\r\n",
