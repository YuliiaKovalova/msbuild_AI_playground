  "body": "Update Microsoft.BuildXL.Processes\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation behind this update is to bring in a bug fix related to the BuildXL.Process assembly depending on BuildXL.Tracing, which is not available in the package.\r\n\r\nBefore and after:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/6445614/05081801-5d31-42fe-bb09-31c3c91a40f8)\r\n\r\nThis change also adjusts a breaking change to `ChildProcessesToBreakawayFromSandbox`, as well as added some extra logic associated with the reason behind the breaking change which supports `dotnet` scenarios better. This is just future-proofing though since reporting file accesses via detours is currently only available in MSBuild.exe.",
