  "body": "Minor change to remove an extra defensive copy of an array. A `BuildRequestData` ctor overload copies it despite the `this` ctor it calls also copying it.\r\n\r\n~Also a very minor perf change to use an array and copy via `CopyTo` instead of cloning with a `List<>`.~",

You did make me realize something important though; `ICollection` is technically mutable, so changing to an array for the underlying type breaks that. I'll put it back at a `List<>`",
