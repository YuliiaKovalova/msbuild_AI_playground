  "title": "Make matching case insensitive regardless of OS Fixes #5749",
  "body": "First commit: update a test such that it passes only if matching is case insensitive.\r\nSecond commit: modify FileUtilities.ComparePathsNoThrow such that it can be made to be always case sensitive or case insensitive. Note that this was changed about seven months ago in [#4997](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/4997) where it had previously been a todo to make case sensitivity depend on OS but that implemented it.\r\nThird commit: fix a test that theoretically ensured case insensitivity but in practice did not, changed to care about case in the same PR.\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes #5749.",

Is the customer open to changing by then and is that the ultimate behavior we want to drive towards?  We could put a flag in just for this customer to opt out but that'll complicate our testing.  I don't think we'd want to go back to the way we were before since it's already been two releases this way and going back could break other customers (though is admittedly less likely to break customers than switching to be case-sensitive)",

It's probably the best way, but it's hard to take advantage of that in our case, so I'd consider it only slightly beneficial and slightly more of a breaking change.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, for going back to break someone, they would have had to:\r\n1) Be developing on Linux,\r\n2) Have two files with the same path but different casings,\r\n3) Have item operations that apply to one but not the other of them, and\r\n4) Have added that very recently.",
