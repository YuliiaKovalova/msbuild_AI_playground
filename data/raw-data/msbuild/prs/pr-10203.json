  "title": "Write output from tests",
  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nBoth VSTest and testing frameworks (especially xunit) write additional information to screen. Either by writing to console, or by sending Test messages. \r\n\r\nUntil now users cannot see the messages on screen which degrades the experience to them. \r\n\r\nThis includes not being able to see discovered tests when `--list-tests` is used, or not being able to see output written by tests. \r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdds a test specific message type that we can use to write an immediate message. This is probably not the best fit, but it is the most unified with what is existing on TL right now.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNo new tests, I am leaning on what is already there.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis is how it looks like when someone has few tests written in MSTest and Xunit. \r\n\r\n![msbuild_output](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/5735905/adf857cb-b185-47d7-916e-ba6c1654d233)\r\n\r\n",
