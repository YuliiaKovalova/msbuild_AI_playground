Ultimately, it isn't currently public, so we can always just add it then, though it would be more work to take it out and re-add it.\r\n\r\nI also considered this. Given it's private, and many callers are doing work to compute the capacity, I favour removing it. If needed in future, we can use this commit for reference.",
