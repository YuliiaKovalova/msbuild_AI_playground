  "title": "Fix WinFX casing and targets import",
  "body": "I brought all the changes from #5346 and fixed import of `WinFX` targets on case-sensitive file-system and then updated #5200 logic.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/26f6d1d87700faa8b38d215dbde5968e6b8381f6/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NETFramework.CurrentVersion.targets#L129\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/26f6d1d87700faa8b38d215dbde5968e6b8381f6/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L6151\r\n\r\nThese targets point to `WinFX` casing but has `WinFx` casing in the `MSBuildToolsPath`. This will result in file not found, if the targets get imported in a case-sensitive file-system. Since, no one used WinFX targets on Mono, they have not been reported, I think.\r\n\r\nAlso NETFX 2 has `WinFX` casing but NETFX 4 has `WinFx` casing. So, In order to cope with both `WinFX` and `WinFx`, I renamed the redirection targets to the correct case and then added a workaround which F# team uses to import either ones on a case-sensitive file system.",

I made sure that we would not regress anything.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've made changes to the way the `ImportFrameworkWinFXTargets` is used. So this PR is required.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider and reopen this PR.",
