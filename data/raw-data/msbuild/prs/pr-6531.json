  "title": "Fix *.* wildcard glob matching regression",
  "body": "Fixes #6502\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a regression in glob matching where files without extension are erroneously not matched when taking a specific globbing code path.\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nAny customer who uses a glob pattern susceptible to the bug and has files without extensions in their source tree is affected. The bug was reported by external customers.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, caused by #6151 where glob matching was optimized which internally made it take a different code path.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nFixes the regression by properly handling `*.*` to mean all files, not just files with a dot in the name. This convention is used in .NET APIs on all platforms and matches the pre-regression behavior.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded unit test coverage. Also verified locally with the repro provided by the original bug reporter.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow. The star patterns are special-cased to mean all files, other patterns are unaffected.",
