        "body": "Team triage: This sounds risky. It's generally considered good to have reproducible builds, and the start time of your build, expressed as a property that affects build behavior, explicitly makes that harder in that the start time will differ between builds no matter how reproducible other parts of the build are. That makes this a potential (if misused) source of numerous bugs. We're not inclined to take this.\r\n\r\nIf you really want the start time, you can get it by building some time-getting project/target at the start of your build.",
