It looks like their change was merged in already: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/ee940d2ee61058587198a9d879c8f2fd897dc260 is there a way to force maestro to generate a PR from arcade with newer bits?\r\n\r\nMaybe _now_ if we close it, the next generated PR will include the commit we need. Closing to see what happens with the next PR.",
