  "body": "Related to https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2835\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nUpdate Packages.props to utilizes properties defined in versions.props which get overridden by the built versions in source-build.  This eliminates prebuilts.  Before these changes, references to 6.0.0 were being added instead of the current versions e.g. System.Text.Json,6.0.4.  \r\n\r\nI applied the same change to all 6.0.0 references.  This is only a problem for System.Text.Json but will be once the other packages are serviced for 6.0.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRan a complete source-build to validate the prebuilts were removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
