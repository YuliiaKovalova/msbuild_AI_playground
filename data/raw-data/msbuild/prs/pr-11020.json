Is it necessary to request these pics? \r\n",

SVG is great, but AI/PDF are fine too.\r\n\r\nA vector-based version of the logo can be used in more places. For example, to print stickers/posters with the logo, you'd want much higher resolution, and vectors can scale to any size. It'd allow us to produce the 128x128px version ourselves.",
