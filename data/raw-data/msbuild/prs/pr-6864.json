  "body": "\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6842#issuecomment-921168797\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nWe use static for the `CoreClrAssemblyLoader` field so each unique SDK resolver assembly is loaded into memory and JITted only once. All subsequent load requests will return assembly from the assembly loader's cache instead of loading it again from disk. This change increases the performance of SDK resolution and at the same time avoids leaking memory due to loading the same SDK resolver assembly multiple times and never unloading it.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nThe `CoreClrAssemblyLoader` field in the `SdkResolverLoader` class was changed from non-static to static member. The same instance of `CoreClrAssemblyLoader` will be used by all instances of `SdkResolverLoader`. It is consistent now with other uses of `CoreClrAssemblyLoader` in msbuild.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested manually using repro from https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/5037#issuecomment-917981250\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nAlternative approach would be to use collectible `CoreClrAssemblyLoader` / `AssemblyLoadContext` - that would fix the leak as well but it would be less performant as it wouldn't benefit from re-using already loaded and JITed assemblies.
