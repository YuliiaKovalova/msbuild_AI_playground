  "body": "Backport of  https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10942.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10877 and #10873.\r\n\r\nWork item (Internal use): \r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nRespect `WarningsAsMessages`, `WarningsAsErrors`, `WarningsNotAsErrors`, and `TreatWarningsAsErrors` in addition to their `MSBuild`-prefixed versions in all projects, not just ones that import `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets`.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReduced complexity in opting to keep warnings as warnings, making it easier to configure warnings how you expect.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo, this behavior is longstanding. It's higher severity now due to the NuGet Audit warnings, which are often created in one project (where a package is referenced) but raised in another (where the restore actually happened), which may have the easy-to-type form of the property but not the respected-before-this-change one.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nNew and existing automated tests.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nMedium-low. Users almost certainly intended this behavior and it works this way in most project types. To mitigate risk further, the behavior can be reverted to the prior behavior with an environment variable (changewave).",
