  "body": "Follow up to #11781.\r\n\r\nThis updates the workflows to reflect that this repository has the labeler disabled for pull requests. By removing \"pulls\" from the cache-retention job, that job will not try to restore the pulls model (and fail). The job should be green daily to show the issues model was successfilly restored (and therefore prediction can succeed).\r\n\r\nThis also adds comments to the workflows and a markdown file documenting the configuration of the issue-labeler, based on feedback received in another repo.",
