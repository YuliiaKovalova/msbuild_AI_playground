  "body": "Fixes #6917 by ensuring that the copy-marker file is _always_ added\r\nto the FileWrites item if the copy-referenced-assemblies target runs\r\nso that IncrementalClean never sees it as an 'orphan' file and then\r\ndeletes it.\r\n\r\nWork item (Internal use): [AB#1417029](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1417029)\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nIn some common situations, Visual Studio will not build a project that should build. \r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThis can result in debugging or unit test execution running against stale binaries that don't have the user's latest changes. That's a baffling and intensely frustrating user experience.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, in Visual Studio 16.11.4 and 17.0-preview3.\r\n\r\nThe bug is longstanding (since 15.6), but was masked by #6576 which caused Visual Studio overbuild.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nPrivate patching shows expected behavior; users experiencing the problem who applied a roughly-equivalent workaround have reported that it fixes their issues and not reported new ones.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow. Adds a file to the list of files that would be written to the output directory. We validated that adding nonexistent files to that list is harmless, so even if the file doesn't get written (for some reason) builds will still succeed.\r\n\r\nHowever, this target is run in basically all builds, so unexpected impacts would potentially have wide scope.\r\n",
