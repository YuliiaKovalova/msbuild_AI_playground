  "body": "Fixes #7995\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n#6924 changed how `IsRidAgnostic` works.  Normally, the .NET SDK should set the `IsRidAgnostic` property (added in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/21986).  But when using an older version of the .NET SDK, there is fallback logic in the GetTargetFrameworksWithPlatformForSingleTargetFramework target to replicate the previous logic.\r\n\r\nHowever, this fallback logic was incorrect, as it was setting item metadata, but reading from the property to determine whether to set it to the default value.  So if the property wasn't set, the `IsRidAgnostic` metadata would always be `false`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManual testing\r\n",

Can you update the comment to be clearer on at what point that happens?\r\n\r\n`$(IsRidAgnostic)` refers to a property and `%(IsRidAgnostic)` refers to item metadata.  I've updated the comment to try to make it more clear.",
