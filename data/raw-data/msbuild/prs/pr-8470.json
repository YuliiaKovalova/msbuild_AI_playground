Or are there reasons not to?\r\n\r\nMaestro does not support upgrading to released versions, only internal builds, so it's not possible to use it here. I think Dependabot can update SDK versions but Arcade has us use them in a nonstandard way so it doesn't apply to us either.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't _mind_ automation but building it as a one-off sounds annoying.",
