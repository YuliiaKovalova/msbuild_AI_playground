  "body": "Fixes #7528\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nIf a project reference does not exist, we currently throw a warning. It was requested in #7528 that there should at least be an option to make it an error.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThrows a warning or an error, depending on the ErrorOnMissingProjectReference property, if a ProjectReference does not exist.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTried building a project with a nonexistent project reference with and without that property set to True.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nI don't think the discussion on the issue had fully resolved, but I suspect it won't resolve any time soon. Regardless, if you think this is hurtful in any way, feel free to just close it.",

I cannot think anywhere a warning for non-existent project would be useful or required.\r\n\r\nOne solid reason and one not-so-solid reason:\r\nIf there are people that are currently seeing warnings for something that doesn't exist but have that warning suppressed, I don't want to suddenly make those warnings into errors. That would be a breaking change for something that's pretty harmless, albeit probably unintentional.\r\n\r\nI also vaguely remember someone giving a reason that sounded pretty convincing to me, but I can't remember at the moment what it was...something to do with a project that might be there or might not be, and if it's there you should build it, but if not, it isn't necessarily a problem. Maybe it was something like a generated .props file that should affect your build if present, but if it's absent, that just means to use all the defaults. It might be created at some point during the build or later when using the app, but if it isn't there, that just means it's a clean machine, so don't worry about it.",

Still hope that this could be an Error-only someday.",
