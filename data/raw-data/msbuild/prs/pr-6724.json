  "title": "SetPlatform Negotiation: Allow MSBuild `GetTargetFrameworks` call when `SetTargetFramework` already set",
  "body": "### Context\r\nFix potential issue where an already-set 'SetTargetFramework' metadata on a `ProjectReference` item would skip logic required for SetPlatform negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhen `SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties` is true, it skips the MSBuild call to `GetTargetFrameworks`. I modified a condition to ensure it wouldn't be set to true when opted into the feature, but just below that was this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n      <_MSBuildProjectReferenceExistent Condition=\"'%(_MSBuildProjectReferenceExistent.SetTargetFramework)' != ''\">\r\n        <SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties>true</SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties>\r\n      </_MSBuildProjectReferenceExistent>\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if we skipped setting `SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties` to true, it would still be set to true if `SetTargetFramework` was set. This would skip the call to `GetTargetFrameworks`, which would prevent the proper metadata being added to the item before GetCompatiblePlatform is called, likely resulting in a warning and the project being built with no metadata\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAdded a condition not to set `SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties` when opted into platform negotiation.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNot tested yet.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nOne of those \"wake up in the middle of the night and this hits you\" moments.",
