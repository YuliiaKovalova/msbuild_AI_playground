It looks like I looked at this bug over two years ago and thought the problem may have been because the Message task didn't support changing the code page directly and may have been that the user needed to change how they were using a ToolTask. Assuming this does fix the problem, though this sounds like a positive change, I'd say it suggests the problem should have been fixed by whoever implemented the ToolTask that is ultimately broken; all they would've had to do is set that property as you did here except in their ToolTask extension. In fact, I'd argue that's a better fix, as this one changes fairly fundamental behavior in MSBuild, which always has potential to cause someone issues even if the change looks benign.\r\n\r\nJust my 2c \ud83d\ude42",
