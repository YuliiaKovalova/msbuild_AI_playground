It would also presumably improve performance a bit since we could escape a bunch of random conditions like Condition=\"'$(IsMonoBuild)' == 'True'\"\r\n\r\nMy general understanding was that we're not actively adding stuff for mono, but we're also trying not to break things. I feel like we broke something on mono long after we'd stopped doing mono stuff, and someone internal was hurt...@jonathanpeppers maybe?",
