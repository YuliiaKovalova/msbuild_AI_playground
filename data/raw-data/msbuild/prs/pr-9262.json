  "body": "Fixes #9258 \r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nOpting out of 17.8 features (via changewaves env variable) while `EnableUnsafeBinaryFormatterSerialization` is not allowed by the runtime can lead to MSBuild crashing ungracefully.\r\n\r\nThis is because BinaryFormatter serialization usage in core now leads to runtime failures (as of 8.0) unless explicitly opted-in by user. So MSBuild moved to alternative (secure) serialization. MSBuild normally allows users to opt out of the last batch of changes - with changewaves. In this specific case it can mean shooting self into foot without realizing.\r\n\r\nResolution: Ignoring the opt-out of the new secure serialization unless the BinaryFormatter is explicitly allowed by user in runtime (by editing `MSBuild.runtimeconfig.json` in the SDK).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIf users have encountered a problem in the latest MSBuild and are working around it by enabling a changewave (for instance, working around the potential deployment blocker #9250), some categories of build failure manifest as an MSBuild crash rather than a failed build with a descriptive error.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nAllow flipping to the legacy serialization only if the BinFmt is allowed in runtime (or we are running on .NET Framework).\r\nFor exception serialization - it actually should be just internal technical detail without user behavior change - so not allowing to change this with changewave\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, introduced in #8917.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManual (mentioned in the item)\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow (adding boolean check populated from AppContext switch)",
