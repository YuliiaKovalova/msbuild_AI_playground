  "body": "Fixes #8735, possibly #5689, #2845\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThere were race condition when `ProjectFinished` log message has been processed after `BuildResult` event. Even though `ProjectFinished` log message event is always send before `BuildResult` event from Node, because `ProjectFinished` is asyncronously routed by `LoggingService` reversing order can and do often happen.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nUpdating `_overallBuildSuccess` in one place when submission is considered to be done and assumed its final state.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nCan't local repro.",
