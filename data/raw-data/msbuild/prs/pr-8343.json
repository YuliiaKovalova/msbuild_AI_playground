  "title": "[FancyLogger] Make internal",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nFancyLogger, the future console logger for MSBuild, makes use of many internal classes which were mistakenly made public and included in the public API. These should be made internal as to avoid users relying on them or causing breaking changes when updating them.\r\n\r\nRemoves new public API preventing users from accessing or relying on helper classes and methods that are only intended to make the logger work. \r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThere is new public API exposed in 17.5 that customers could discover and depend on (and which would need to be documented). It's not intended for extension and the API may be unstable as we evolve the logger.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNot a regression, hiding new-to-17.5 functionality.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nManual validation by @edvilme and @rainersigwald and automated tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nLow",
