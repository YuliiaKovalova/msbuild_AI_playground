  "body": "Fixes #\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nIn https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7390 I modified some of the event source methods but I just noticed that things look wrong in the latest internal preview.  It seems like Start/Stop event methods need to have the same version in order to be linked up.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17556515/160435872-0361f11c-28e5-4092-bbd5-32e5e9bd0aec.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17556515/160435918-2145caf9-40d4-485f-bec8-8e2a1a8f970a.png)\r\n\r\nI'm working on event messages like this in NuGet and just used a constant to rev the version of all event methods at the same time which seems like a better practice in general.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\nAdd a constant to represent the event method version and use that version in all event methods.  \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nManually tested locally, these are the events logged now:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17556515/160436284-02393ca2-e430-4399-87e9-878fd23002b9.png)\r\n\r\nHere is a sample for others to verify as well:\r\n\r\n[PerfViewData.etl.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/8364311/PerfViewData.etl.zip)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
