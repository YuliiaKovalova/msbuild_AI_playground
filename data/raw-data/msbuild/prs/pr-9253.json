  "body": "Fixes #9245\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThe test was disabled to unblock PR CI.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nIncreased the relevant timeout.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThe test is reliably passing now.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be an issue with [the sleep command](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/914c3e867444ac178bdc4dca78431871bebb415f/src/Shared/UnitTests/ObjectModelHelpers.cs#L1982) we use on Windows. In some cases PowerShell can take a super long time to start. I have been able to reproduce locally by enabling Fusion logging. Thread times of the `powershell` process:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/12206368/76cbe00f-5f5e-496a-8037-0d40f53a9392)\r\n\r\nWe spend almost 10 seconds just loading assemblies, so the timeout of 10 seconds for the entire build was not enough.\r\n\r\nI don't have a full understanding of the mechanism that slows down PowerShell this much. At this point I'm happy we were able to confirm it's not a product issue, although I'm wondering if there is a better and more light-weight sleep command we could use on Windows instead (e.g. `ping 127.0.0.1 -n <seconds>`). Reviewers please opine.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In my trace, file system operations block extensively with `wdfilter.sys` on the stack, so the likely explanation for the issue appearing all of a sudden is a Defender update.",
