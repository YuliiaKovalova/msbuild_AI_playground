I'm inclined to agree with him. Is your concern here that you don't see a scenario in which someone could want to do this, or is there some reason you think it would actively hurt customers if they try to do it?\r\n \r\n> If it is allowed, I don't understand why we should attempt to print targets after preprocessing has failed--what's the scenario there?\r\n\r\nSlight misunderstanding here\u2014if preprocessing fails, we currently _do_ continue on and still (if requested) try to print targets. I think there's an argument that if we fail to preprocess the project file, we should skip printing targets, but I'm not concerned with that issue in this PR. What does concern me is if we fail to preprocess then go on to try to create a list of targets and succeed for some reason because then the build result would be \"success,\" and the user would be very confused.",
