This causes the QB cache plugin to fail (qb.exe works because it has binding redirects, but the plugin fails because it's a dll and dlls don't have binding redirects).\r\nBoth MSBuild and VS ship with System.Memory 4.0.1.1 so this should not have any negative consequences.\r\n\r\nIn general, shouldn't MSBuild add binding redirects for [all the assemblies that it redistributes](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/9bcc06cbe19ae2482ab18eab90a82fd079b26897/src/Package/MSBuild.VSSetup/files.swr#L39-L52)?

This is going to start forcing tasks to run on MSBuild's assembly if the one they carry is lower, I guess that's OK.  In general MSBuild shouldn't force redirection as it can have side-effects on the task (we've had MSBuild redirect us into breaking NuGet changes in the past).  Tasks should see it as their own responsibility to handle redirects for their assemblies.  cc @dsplaisted @rainersigwald ",

AFAIK that does not work with assemblies redistributed by MSBuild because the redistributed assemblies are placed next to msbuild.exe (the appdomain's appbase) and thus the CLR does not issue resolve events for those.\r\n\r\n> This is going to start forcing tasks to run on MSBuild's assembly if the one they carry is lower, I guess that's OK.\r\n\r\nSince MSBuild is redistributing this dll I assume the engine really needs it in order to function. And since the engine's dependencies are not isolated from the plugins' dependencies, they all swim in the same type space, so by choosing to redistribute a dll, MSBuild is actually forcing all plugins to use its redistributed version right? Hence the binding redirect just formalizes that and prevents accidentally loading the plugin's assembly first and potentially crashing the engine. One way or another something might crash, and it's probably better if it's not the engine?",

Only time it doesn't raise the event is when the assembly loads correctly (in which case you didn't need the redirect).  I did a quick test and a DLL with matching name and wrong version will raise the event.\r\n\r\n> so by choosing to redistribute a dll, MSBuild is actually forcing all plugins to use its redistributed version right?\r\n\r\nThey could load a version side-by-side in the same app domain, which is fine so long as they don't need to exchange the types with MSBuild.\r\n\r\n> Hence the binding redirect just formalizes that and prevents accidentally loading the plugin's assembly first and potentially crashing the engine\r\n\r\nWhy would that crash?\r\n\r\nYour change may still be OK, but I think it should be more complete by establishing a crisper stance about how to think about these dependencies.  For instance: MSBuild will provide assemblies X, Y, Z etc.  You don't need to include these with your tasks.  Just reference packages X, Y, Z versions NNN and exclude them from your package.  In fact, I bet MSBuild could provide a single PackageReference that represents what's \"safe\" for tasks to use without redistributing for a specific version of MSBuild.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to hear from the SDK team on this as this is something they've faced for years.  @dsplaisted @wli3 ",
