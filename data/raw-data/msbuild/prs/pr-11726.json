  "title": "Add single resolver error logging and related tests",
  "body": "### Context\r\nThis change addresses the handling of SDK resolution errors in the `SdkResolverService`. It improves the error logging mechanism by distinguishing between single and multiple resolver scenarios, providing clearer and more informative error messages when SDK resolution fails caters to #10191 \r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- Updated error logging in `SdkResolverService` to differentiate between single and multiple resolver failures.\r\n- Added a new resource string `SingleResolverFailedToResolveSDK` for clearer error messaging related to single resolver failures.\r\n- Introduced a test `AssertSingleResolverErrorLoggedWhenSdkNotResolved` to verify that errors are correctly logged when SDK resolution fails with a single resolver.\r\n- Enhanced `MockLoaderStrategy` to support initialization with only one resolver, making it easier to test single resolver scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- All tests passed successfully, including the newly added test to check for single resolver failure logging behavior.\r\n- Ensured that the new error messages are displayed correctly in both scenarios (single and multiple resolvers).\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- This change improves the clarity of error messages, which can help identify and resolve SDK resolution issues more effectively.\r\n- The test added ensures that the logging mechanism works as intended when only one resolver is involved.\r\n",
