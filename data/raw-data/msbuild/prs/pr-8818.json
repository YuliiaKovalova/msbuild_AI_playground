If not, how can we tell?\r\n\r\nIn most cases addition of these kind of entries to `Version.Details.xml` is related to the dependency in question being loaded in during the build and source-build having a reference package for it, which causes a build failure. These can be unearth by simply building the repo / product.\r\n\r\nCurrently only `System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager` is causing problems. With the work for the issue mentioned in the PRs description complete, similar issues would be caught either in PRs to the repo or to `installer`. In .NET 9 timeframe, with the development of VMR, these issues would be caught in the repo PR only.",
