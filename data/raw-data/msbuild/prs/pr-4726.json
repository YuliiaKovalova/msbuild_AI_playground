  "title": "[Static Graph] Move cache miss error under task logging context",
  "body": "Whenever I get a cache access error, almost all the time I have to debug into msbuild to see what the global properties where.\r\n\r\nOne fix to the problem is to parent the error under the msbuild task's logging context, so that it shows up in the bin log, under the task, as opposed to not showing up at all like it currently happens. This enables one to look at the global properties in the binlog.\r\nRegarding the implementation, the main problem is getting the error message from the build manager node where the scheduler runs and issues the error, to the TaskHost that executes the msbuild task, which may be in a different process. Ideally, we'd need an official mechanism for ferrying these messages. Practically, I just piggy backed on the BuildResult. This seemed like the least intrusive change. Perf wise, the extra message is ferried only when a build fails, so there should be no relevant impact.\r\nRegarding tests, there already are two existing tests that check for this error, so it's already covered:\r\n- CacheEnforcementShouldFailWhenReferenceWasNotPreviouslyBuiltWithoutContinueOnError\r\n- MissingResultFromCacheShouldErrorDueToIsolatedBuildCacheEnforcement\r\n\r\nAnother fix would be to print out the global properties for each the two projects involved in the message. But I considered that the previous fix also enables the binlogger to display the error in the first place, so it has more benefit.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2255729/64829989-72810180-d583-11e9-8087-246e5245d4eb.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2255729/64829926-3057c000-d583-11e9-85c3-b985d9c6e93e.png)\r\n",
