So I was thinking about taking these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Merge this PR. The diff is a traditional branding update that's done after cutting a release branch. The reason I am annoyingly insisting on doing that is that it fits the established pattern.\r\n2. Delete the `vs17.0` branch.\r\n3. Repoint #6361 to main and merge. #6361 is a major version branding update so it's great that it has its own PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: There's actually step 0. Merge #6409 so `main` history goes nicely from 16.10 to 16.11 to 17.0.",
