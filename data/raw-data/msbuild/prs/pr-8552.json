  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nOriginall implementation did not expect multiple instances of BuildManager called concurrently. But in VS DTB and normal build are run concurrently.\r\n\r\nThis is backported from main PR #8444 \r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nIn rare cases Dictionary data structure is corrupted and can cause infinite loop. This affect only VS scenarios. \r\nIt is currently #7 ranked VS hang issue.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, introduced in VS 17.4.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nManual validation by @rokonec and automated tests. Additionally it has been in bleeding edge VS for about three weeks.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow",
