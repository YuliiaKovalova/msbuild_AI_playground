  "body": "Part of #4779\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nMake Common props, targets and tasks easier to read and understand.\r\nFixup whitespace and new lines only in Common props, targets and tasks files.\r\n\r\nPart of the larger refactoring that'll lead into #1686\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n - Remove all trailing spaces\r\n - Fixup new lines where necessary\r\n   - Add new lines between every block to make it clear.\r\n   - Remove unnecessary new lines to reduce scrolling.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nI'll also make sure not to mess up the git blame too much.\r\nTo make reviewing easier, I had split up the changes logically rather than a file.\r\nAlso, please do note that these changes won't make much difference alone but with other formatting and refactors that follow this will make a world of difference in reading these files.",
