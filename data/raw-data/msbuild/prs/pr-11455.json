  "body": "and making it into an abstract overrridden function instead\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWhile going through the review for Eric's performance PRs I've had some difficulties in tracking to code flow due to the delegate usage. This is a PR to open a discussion about a possibility of replacing some of the delegates with a combination of an abstract function + override.\r\nThe downside is an introduction of a variable to store the factory which is otherwise used from a closure. Refactoring this factory away collides with nodeInProc/nodeOutOfProc separation and could result in code duplication. \r\nIf there is a better way to pass the factory around, I'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nreplaced internal delegate void NodeContextCreatedDelegate(NodeContext context);\r\nwith \r\nprotected abstract void CreateNode(NodeContext context);\r\nso that I keep the idea of NodeProviderOutOfProc & NodeProviderOutOfProcTaskHost can use the same structure while removing the delegate since tracking it add additional level of indirection to the code flow.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIf current tests still work then I will take that as a sign that I didn't break anything.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nA quick PR to open a discussion about some of the delegates we have.\r\nThere is at least one similar delegate in place I would like to remove as well if we find this approach reasonable.\r\n",
