  "body": "This reverts commit a93882f9b95461f73394e49496f81582d0089c6c.\r\n\r\nThis is a 17.6 fix for #8684\r\n\r\nThe plan is to revert #8275 in 17.6, as it caused some difficulties, and try to bring it back in 17.7 via #8685.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n#8275 introduced a new issue in which copying a file onto itself could often just delete the file instead of copying anything. Customers reported this issue.\r\n\r\nIt also fixed a longstanding confusing and unfortunate behavior in MSBuild in which passing the Copy task a symlink as its destination would copy the source file onto the destination of the symlink rather than overwriting the symlink. We will attempt to fix again in a later release.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nProjects that copy a file onto itself using the Copy task without passing identical paths for source and destination instead delete the file without necessarily even logging an error.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8275.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manually tested that the repro described in #8684 no longer fails.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal (straight revert of the commit that caused the bug)",
