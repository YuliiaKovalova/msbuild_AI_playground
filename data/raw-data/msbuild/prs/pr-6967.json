  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6961\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n> BannedApiAnalyzers has some intentional old dependencies and it's not feasible to build it during source-build. It's already been removed from source-build and we need to remove usages. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/5619\r\n> \r\n> BannedApiAnalyzers isn't one of the analyzers that ends up in the SDK product, so the only reason for source-build to build it is for code validation parity when building MSBuild's C# source code. That would help source-build developers write upstreamable code if the MSBuild C# code needs to be patched, but dev flows aren't the primary goal of source-build right now.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nMoved `GlobalPackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers\"` into an item group that is excluded during source-build, so the analyzer isn't referenced or used.\r\n",
