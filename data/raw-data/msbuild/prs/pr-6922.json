This can mess with incremental builds.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThis change adds an output parameter, `CopiedAtLeastOneFile` to the `Copy` task that the `Touch` task is now conditioned off of.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested local builds\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis could also be done by having an ITaskItem[] that contains all files that were actually copied. Then the touch task could check if that item were empty. I opted for the straightforward route since the ITaskItem[] solution isn't needed yet, and this implementation can easily be changed when we do need that.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Forgind <Forgind@users.noreply.github.com>",
