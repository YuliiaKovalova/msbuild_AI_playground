  "body": "Part of #11160\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nWhile profiling some of Eric's PRs and one of my experiments, I've noticed following:\r\n<img width=\"953\" alt=\"terminall_loger_get_width_height_cost\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb3478c3-e669-4911-b6b0-0c834e38305e\" />\r\nTerminal width/height are behind a lock and repeated access is quite expensive.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nI've set it so that the update is happening only once every ~second or so. This makes the cost negligible.\r\nNote that this appears to be ~1.5% CPU time saved on the main node, which is the one under heaviest load due to IPC with all the other nodes.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNone, this should be non-disruptive change.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nRefresh frequency is up to discussion. Making it twice a second should be fine as well.\r\n",
