  "body": "Addresses the change in disabling CG step - introduced here https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/13214/files\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n`disableComponentGovernance` is by default set for non-prod branches, where prod branch is recognized via name as 'main' or '*internal/release*'. MSBuild has nonstandard naming in this case and needs adjustment\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n* Explicitly add the '/eng/common/templates/jobs/jobs.yml' template (not sure if that's correct, but I suppose this is otherwise somehow implicitly imported). Is this correct @wtgodbe?\r\n* Added the conditional `disableComponentGovernance` for this template - recognizing prod branches by name as 'main' or 'vs*'\r\n* Indented the `Windows_NT` job, to be using the jobs.yml template (again - not sure if this is correct)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nOpen questions (@wtgodbe - can you please address those?):\r\n * Is this proper way of injecting the `disableComponentGovernance`, since we haven't explicitly used the jobs.yml template before?\r\n * Do we need to distinguish internal mirror run somehow other than `eq(parameters.runAsPublic, 'false')`? We do not have internal brnaches as other repos.\r\n * Is this no-op when going in prior consuming the Arcade change introduced in introduced here https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/13214/files?",
