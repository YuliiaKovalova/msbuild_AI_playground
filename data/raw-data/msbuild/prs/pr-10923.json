  "body": "### Context\r\nBuildcheck is outputing helplinks as part of its diagnostics - e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning BC0201: https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#BC0201 - Property: 'GITHUB_TOKEN' was accessed, but it was never initialized.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the link is missleading for custom checks - as we do not have any help for those\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning DU0201: https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#DU0201 - Location: 'C:\\Users\\jankrivanek\\Downloads\\secrets-redaction-demo-main\\secrets-redaction-demo-main' cannot be fully trusted, place your projects outside of that folder (Project: secrets-redaction-demo.csproj).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThe help link is provided only for internaly reported diagnostics\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nExisting tests\r\n",
