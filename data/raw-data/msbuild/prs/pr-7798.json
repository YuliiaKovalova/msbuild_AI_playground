  "title": "Use package version properties for dependabot project during source build",
  "body": "### Context\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2933\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- During source-build, set PackageReferences to versions specified by their respective `*Version` properties (like `SystemCodeDomVersion` for example). Source-build will define and import properties for packages that are available during source-build.\r\n- Then, if any of the packages didn't have *Version properties set, set them to the dependabot-managed versions.\r\n- During a non-source-build build, these dependencies should all be set to their dependabot-managed versions, since none of these dependencies have versions properties defined in `eng/Versions.props`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI tested the msbuild build locally by running `./build.sh` on Linux. I also tested this commit in source-build locally and confirmed that packages in this file no longer report as prebuilts. Here is the prebuilt report from my local build.\r\n\r\n[msbuild-annotated-prebuilt-usage.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/9067964/msbuild-annotated-prebuilt-usage.txt)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThere is still the open question of if dependabot can read and update these dependencies with conditions in their PackageReferences. I spent too long trying to get dependabot to run locally with no luck. I dug into the source code at it appears they use a proper XML parsing library.\r\n\r\nHere is where it looks for PackageReferences: \r\nhttps://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/8315e7b213870959158c1c2bcfb482728a7e801a/nuget/lib/dependabot/nuget/file_parser/project_file_parser.rb#L17-L21\r\n\r\nHere is where it looks for the Version of each PackageReference: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/8315e7b213870959158c1c2bcfb482728a7e801a/nuget/lib/dependabot/nuget/file_parser/project_file_parser.rb#L195\r\n\r\nOf course if dependabot fails to work with this pattern we can revert and revisit this. I'm opening as draft to check for feedback.",
