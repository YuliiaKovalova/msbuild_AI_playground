  "title": "Attempt to prevent node explosions with parallel node creation",
  "body": "### Context\r\nA long time ago, I was struggling with a bug in which we created thousands of MSBuild nodes. ~~Looking at our code for creating nodes, we fail early in NodeProviderOutOfProc if (_nodeContexts.Count == ComponentHost.BuildParameters.MaxNodeCount). We have an equivalent check in NodeProviderOutOfProcTaskHost. We don't in NodeProviderInProc, presumably because we shouldn't ever have > 1 in proc node.~~\r\n\r\nActually, I don't think this is true because _nodeContexts aren't shared between providers. That said, rainersigwald pointed out this is still helpful if we parallelize this.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if the explosion might be avertable by changing the \u200b==\u200b\u00a0to \u200b>=\u200b. If we haven't used the in-proc node for whatever reason and we use MaxNodeCount nodes, and then we create an in-proc node, we'd have MaxNodeCount + 1 nodes, and we could spiral out of control because the `==` checks would no longer be valid.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nSwitched equality to >= or <= as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nNone. I'm not exactly sure how to set up a situation in which the in-proc node isn't there until MaxNodeCount has been exhausted, then decides to be used. Could happen also if the in-proc node dies for some reason, but I think that would kill the build.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nMaybe not useful; not sure, but it seemed like an easy and possibly impactful change. Computer deaths can be really frustrating.",
