  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n#6151 introduced a regression where `FileMatcher` takes the pattern `*.*` too literally and returns only files that have a dot in the name. `*.*` should be special cased to mean all files in the directory, with or without an extension.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nFixed the regression by explicitly testing for `*.*` and added test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nExisting and modified unit tests, repro project from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16185#issuecomment-794428841.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nTesting for both `*` and `*.*` is already happening elsewhere in the class. MSBuild calls `Directory.EnumerateFileSystemEntries` which under the covers uses `MatchType.Win32` and causes this behavior of unifying `*.*` with `*` on all platforms. ",
