  "body": "### Context\r\n`FEATURE_SPAN` is defined only when building the .NET Core flavor of MSBuild but the feature has been supported everywhere but downlevel .NET Framework for some time.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nRemoved `FEATURE_SPAN` together with all code conditionally compiled when the flag was **not** defined. Wrapped the code in `#if !CLR2COMPATIBILITY` instead as it's not used when building MSBuildTaskHost.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nExisting unit tests. There might be some very minor perf win on non-Windows OSes where we were previously using strings (i.e. Mono).\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis is code cleanup.",
