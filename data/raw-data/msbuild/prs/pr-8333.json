  "body": "\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThe error message \"Certificate signing not supported on .NET Core\" is logged in ResolveManifestKey because signing from a PFX file is not enabled. `FEATURE_PFX_SIGNING`. In other places, like in `ResolveAssemblyKey()` just above, it will give the error message \"PFX signing not supported on .NET Core\" which is a lot less confusing.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nChanged the error message logged.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
