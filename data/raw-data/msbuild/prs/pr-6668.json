  "body": "Fixes #1062\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThe import based on this property was introduced as a temporary bootstrapping\r\nmechanism before there was packaging extensibility available for multi-targeting.\r\n\r\nThe packaging mechanism (aka NuGet) now uses `buildCrossTargeting`/`buildMultiTargeting`,\r\nsimilar to `build` package folder to hold and import multi-targeting logic via NuGet's Restore.\r\n\r\nThus, we don't need this workaround anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nRemoved the temporary import based on `CoreCrossTargetingTargetsPath`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nSince there are no tests for this property, as it is with all the workarounds\u2026 We'll see if we break anyone during the self-hosting period.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis patch was already a part of #6161. Since, the change was approved independently, I have separated this into a new PR.",
