  "body": "### Summary\n\nFix a reported regression that causes MSBuild to crash in net35-targeting projects.\n\n### Customer Impact\n\nProjects that use the .NET 3.5 taskhost (like projects that target .NET 3.5 and have `.resx` files) fail with `error MSB4217: Task host node exited prematurely.`\n\n### Regression?\n\nYes, from 17.7. Introduced in #9214.\n\n### Testing\n\nRepro case from VSUnitTesting repo manually validated, automated tests.\n\n### Risk\n\nLow, adds a bool to the translation only in the known-broken case.\n\n### Details\n\nTaskHostTaskComplete packets can be sent between nodes that differ in\nFEATURE_REPORTFILEACCESS, causing confusion when the sending side (for\nexample a net35 taskhost) does not send the FileAccessData field, but\nthe receiving side (net48) expects it.\n\nUnify this by explicitly sending a bool `false` (no data) in the\n!FEATURE_REPORTFILEACCESS case, so there's no difference on the\nreceiving end between \"no data\" and \"couldn't be any data\".",
