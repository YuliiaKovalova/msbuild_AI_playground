  "body": "**Customer Impact**\r\nCustomers trying to deploy their .NET Core app w/ClickOnce will not have the application assembly and application EXE authenticode signed with the cert they set in their ClickOnce settings.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nCore ClickOnce .NET Core scenarios for both .net 3.1 and .net 5.0 have been validated by sujitn;johnhart;ningli;yaya.\r\nCTI team has completed full test validation.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The changes are scoped to .NET Core ClickOnce deployment when signing is enabled in the ClickOnce settings.\r\n\r\n**Code Reviewers**\r\njohnhart\r\n\r\n**Description of fix**\r\nDuring ClickOnce publish, the application assembly DLL and wrapper EXE are not getting signed when signing is enabled in the ClickOnce settings. \r\n\r\nThis change will invoke SignFile msbuild task to sign the built assembly dll and exe. For the PublishSingleFile=false case, it will sign apphost.exe (which gets copied to myapp.exe) and for the PublishSingleFile=true case, it will sign the final bundle EXE.\r\n",
