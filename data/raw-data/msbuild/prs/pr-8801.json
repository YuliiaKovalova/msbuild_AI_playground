  "body": "Fixes [AB#1822000](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1822000)\r\n\r\nWork item (Internal use): [AB#1822000](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1822000/)\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nClickOnce does not enforce SHA256 digest algo during RFC3161 timestamping of signed artifacts. For binaries, this means that depending on the version of signtool used, SHA1 is selected as the default digest algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nClickOnce signing task has been updated to default to sha256 as the timestamping digest algo for both binary and manifest signing. For binaries, this is done by passing the /td switch to signtool.exe. For the XML manifests, this is done by passing the sha256 algo id to the CryptRetrieveTimeStamp API. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nDebugged thorough the modified code.\r\nCTI validated signing scenarios with a private.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
