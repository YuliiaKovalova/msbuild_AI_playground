  "body": "(Copied from https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8351)\r\n\r\nFixes [AB#1678521](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1678521)\r\n\r\nContext\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8049 broke the temp filtering logic by using the MSBuild-specific temp path instead of the true base temp path. This manifests as an overbuild of some C++ projects.\r\n\r\nChanges Made\r\nReverted the change. Enabled relevant unit tests.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nExisting unit tests and a C++ end-to-end repro.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nThe rest of FileTracker tests cannot be enabled without significant work (related to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/649).",
