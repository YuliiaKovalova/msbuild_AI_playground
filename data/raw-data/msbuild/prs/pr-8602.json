When ingest queue reaches its bound, at .net472 ManualResetEventSlim causes way too many thread.Yields flooding the system with thread context switches.\r\nThis hypothesis has been verified by PerfMon perfcounter System.ContextSwitches.\r\n\r\nAlhougt counterintuitive, AutoResetEvent , ManualResetEvent or even SpinLocking produced better behavior and with those the issue no longer reproduce.\r\n\r\nCustomer Impact\r\nIn case of XStore it was about 7 minutes in build time.\r\n\r\nRegression?\r\nYes, introduced in VS 17.4.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nManual validation by @rokonec and automated tests. Using local repro to verify changes has fixed it.\r\n\r\nRisk\r\nLow\r\n\r\nNote\r\nIt effect only VS MSBuild.exe. In dotnet build ManualResetEventSlim works better.",
