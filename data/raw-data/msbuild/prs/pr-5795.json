  "title": "Add files missing in ClickOnce SingleFile bundle.",
  "body": "**Customer Impact**\r\nCustomers trying to deploy their .NET 5.0 application w/ClickOnce using Single File Self Contained Deployment mode will see a runtime failure either due to invalid entrypoint EXE name or due to missing Core CLR files (e.g. clrcompression.dll, coreclr.dll, clrjit.dll).\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nCore ClickOnce .NET Core scenarios for both .net 3.1 and .net 5.0 have been validated by sujitn;johnhart;ningli;yaya.\r\nCTI team is doing a full test validation.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\nLow. The changes are scoped to .NET Core ClickOnce deployment in Single File mode.\r\n\r\n**Code Reviewers**\r\njohnhart\r\n\r\n**Description of fix**\r\nWhen a .NET 5.0 app is published with Single-File enabled, not all dependent runtime files are included in the single file bundle EXE. Some files get excluded and need to be published individually along with the SF EXE. The list of these files are output by the GenerateSingleFileBundle target in MS.NET.Publish.targets as the _FilesExcludedFromBundle output group.\r\n\r\nClickOnce's ResolveManifestFiles will now also be passed these additional files when we're doing a single file ClickOnce publish. This will ensure these files getting written to ClickOnce's manifest file. ClickOnce's copy files target has also been updated to copy these extra files along with the existing files (SF EXE, Launcher.exe entrypoint EXe and ClickOnce .manifest file) to the publish folder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the GenerateLauncher ClickOnce task has been updated to do special handling for singlefilehost.exe in addition to apphost.exe. When IsSingleFile is false, apphost.exe is the name of the intermediate EXE. When IsSingleFile is true, singlefilehost.exe is the name of the intermediate EXE. If GenerateLauncher does not handle this name correctly, Launcher's entrypoint point will be set to singlefilehost.exe instead of the final application EXE.\r\n",
