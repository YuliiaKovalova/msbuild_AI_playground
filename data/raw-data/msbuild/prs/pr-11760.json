To properly forward flow into the VMR a repo needs to have the source tag. In normal circumstances, this tag would get created during the first backwards flow (pr from the VMR to the product repo), but in this case, all of the packages that would have gotten the update are excluded, so there is no PR, thus, we have to do add the source tag manually",
