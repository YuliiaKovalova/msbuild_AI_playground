Each branch is required to have a separate loc setup, which should not be invoked from a different branch (then we'd get conflicting PRs as we used to have some time back).\r\n\r\nFor this reason we need to disable the latest release branch localization requests on a new branch creation and issue loc ticket to request swap from (latest-1) to latest.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we can localize main only - then we'd need to only disable the latest release branch loc requests (this PR) and we'd avoid the loc tickets. But we'd need to keep in mind to manually temporarily reroute localization on servicing involving resource files changes (as we already now should with older branches servicing - but that rarely happens)",
