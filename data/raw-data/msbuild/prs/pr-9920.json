But I wonder what's with the translations. In Slavic languages, for example, the situation with the endings is a bit more complicated and has more than 2 cases. So, we definitely can make it more readable for English and some other languages, but we probably cannot cover all the cases. Also, there is one message that has both errors and warnings count, so either we will need to have 4 messages for all the cases, or we need to break the sentence into quite small parts and combine them (which could break other languages which might have some other words order). So, I am hesitant to make the code rely on a particular language model.  I looked how it is done currently in the console logger and saw there one message for both cases. ",
