I want to fix the current state of progress on the issue, as got stuck at this point some time ago. The main problem with other failing tests (besides having lower priority than other things I worked at) is that I am unable to debug step-by-step on mac, and for others it is not clear where the problem is. I will continue to look at them trying to figure out how to fix the rest of them.",
