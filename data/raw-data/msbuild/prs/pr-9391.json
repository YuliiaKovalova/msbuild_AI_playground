I should have made it more apparent in this PR.\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion there, leaving out the `LANG`/`LC_ALL`  (what was merged) is a good option.\r\n\r\n- We're no longer setting something that may be unsupported (fixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4194).\r\n- .NET assumes Unix platforms to have UTF-8 as the default encoding, so we can do the same rather than try to enforce it.\r\n- We're now using the system locale on Unix for the tool process. This is the same as how it behaves on Windows.\r\n\r\n@rainersigwald @wfurt @janvorli @danmoseley @KalleOlaviNiemitalo if it is good for you, I think we can keep this and see what feedback we get during the .NET 9 development.",
