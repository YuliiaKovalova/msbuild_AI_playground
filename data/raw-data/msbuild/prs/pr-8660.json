For example, the .NET Project System in this repo builds on top of the Common Project System (CPS) components, and CPS-based project systems set the `DesignTimeBuild` property. However, non-SDK-style C# and VB projects generally use what we call the \"legacy\" project system, and it uses the `BuildingProject` property.\r\n\r\n> As such, you should make use of both the `DesignTimeBuild` and `BuildingProject` properties to determine whether a target is running in a design-time build or a normal build:\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"AddAdditionalReferences\" BeforeTargets=\"ResolveAssemblyReferences\">\r\n    <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(DesignTimeBuild)' == 'true' OR '$(BuildingProject)' != 'true'\">\r\n        <_AvoidExpensiveCalculation>true</_AvoidExpensiveCalculation>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n    ...\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/main/docs/design-time-builds.md#determining-whether-a-target-is-running-in-a-design-time-build",
