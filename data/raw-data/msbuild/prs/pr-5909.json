  "body": "Add the darc metadata for our dependencies on NuGet and Roslyn. These are toolset dependencies because we use them to construct our bootstrap folder/test environments, but we don't have product code dependencies here--`RoslynCodeTaskFactory` requires Roslyn but doesn't depend on it in the normal way to break cycles/allow floating versions.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes versions only for the Roslyn build task used for unit tests, making it match the toolset version used to make the bootstrap.",
