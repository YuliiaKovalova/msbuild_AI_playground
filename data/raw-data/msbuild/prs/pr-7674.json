          "message": "Log environment-derived properties (#7484)\n\nWe currently log all environment variables, which is useful in giving you a sense of where things come from sometimes but doesn't really tell you if those environment variables are used or what other environment variables we might have expected. This shifts to logging only those environment variables we actually used. This also partially mitigates potential privacy issues, as random environment variables with secrets aren't logged unless they happen to correspond to something MSBuild actually uses during the build.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nKeep track of environment variable usages for looking at properties. Log those in the binlog instead of all environment variables.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, we'd previously kept track of environment-derived properties under more generic types such as ProjectPropertyNotXmlBacked. I added an extension specifically for environment-derived properties. That derived class keeps track of relatively few new things: logging context and whether it's been logged already. In some cases, that logging context is up-to-date; in others, it's invalidated before we could use it, in which case we replace it with the correct logging context as brought forward from wherever we actually had one.\r\n\r\nWith the logging context and information about the property, once we know we need to log it, we log an EnvironmentVariableRead build event. With this change, that event is now properly serialized to the main node, where it is outputted to the binlog and text logs.\r\n\r\nThe binlog viewer was also modified to better accommodate the EnvironmentVariableRead events.\r\n\r\nFinally, the binlog writer was modified such that, unless you specify that you should log all environment variables, it would not output the environment for BuildStarted. I made a similar change for the text logger. I also filtered which properties made it to the event args to weed out environment-derived properties.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nVerified that environment variables are not logged in the binlog by default. Verified that they are logged if they are used. (Also checked the text logs for both.) Modified some unit tests and added one.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nIt seems that all environment-derived properties used in execution go through [this method](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/cd75d014831860da851c61853521fb0b0d9ba63e/src/Build/Evaluation/Expander.cs#L1467). Ideally, that would make this PR tiny: log at that point rather that an BuildStarted. However, there is no single logging context possible at that point, which meant that was brought in from the various ways properties could be used.",
