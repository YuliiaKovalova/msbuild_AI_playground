  "body": "Fixes internally reported bug\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nIf we fail to deserialize a statefile, we used to throw a warning. This was expected to happen once when we changed the serialization technology, but it appears some users have regular design time builds from a different version of MSBuild than the one they used for full builds, which meant they were seeing this warning regularly. This demotes it to a message.",
