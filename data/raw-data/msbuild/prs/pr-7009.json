  "title": "Preventing warning in bootstrapper package self contained scenario",
  "body": "For 16.9 we made a change where bootstrapper packages can specify \"0\" for the public key value of a downloaded file and this will cause the bootstrapper to skip the public key comparison as long as the file is signed with a trusted MS cert.  However, we didn't account for the scenario where a user wants to create a self contained bootstrapper, meaning it will include a copy of the package's installer.  In this scenario we still perform the public key comparison and give a build warning when they don't match.  This change skips this check when the package specifies 0 for the public key of the file in question.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nSee the following thread: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/583383/publickey-token-warning-building-net-core-50-insta.html?childToView=602746#comment-602746\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nSkipping a check when a package's PublicKey value is set to \"0\".\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nVerified we no longer give this warning in this scenario, and that we still give it when the public key is non-zero and doesn't match the file on disk.\r\n",
