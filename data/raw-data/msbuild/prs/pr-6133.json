We're pulling from the release/5.0 branch, which doesn't have epanath's change. Either they would have to merge it back to the release/5.0 branch, or we would have to start pulling from Arcade's master branch, which might be ok.",

We have an issue tracking it https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6119, which we should do in the somewhat near future. Until then, @epananth is it possible to get your change merged into the release/5.0 branch for arcade?",
