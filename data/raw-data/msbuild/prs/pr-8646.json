  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nProjects that have tasks that run in the .NET Framework 3.5 environment that return metadata are unusable in MSBuild 17.6.0.\r\n\r\nThe return value of `ITaskItem.CloneCustomMetadata` is an `IDictionary`, which is generally (in modern MSBuild) backed by a `Dictionary<string, string>`, but can be (when given an item from a net35 taskhost) a `Hashtable`. In the latter situation, casting entries to `KeyValuePair<,>` fails, because they conform only to `DictionaryEntry`.\r\n\r\nUse that less-well-typed approach--the casts were present in the pre-bulk-edit version of the code. Fixes #8645.\r\n\r\nWork item (Internal use): [AB#1790945](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1790945)\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMicrosoft-internal customer reported breaks in projects that use WiX3.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from #8240.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nManual validation of the sample project from customer.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow (fixes cast to match guaranteed behavior and uses only preexisting casts). But we could also revert #8240 entirely.\r\n",
