  "body": "\u2026ion in all scenarios\r\n\r\nFixes [AB#1577754](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1577754)\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nCustomers trying to publish through ClickOnce provider in ADO override the publish directory location by passing in the PublishDir property on the msbuild CLI. If a trailing backslash is not present in the path, publish can fail.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThe msbuild targets file does try to add a trailing backslash to PublishDir if it is not present. However, when passed on the msbuild command line, it's value cannot be changed due to being a global property.\r\nTo work around this, a new property ClickOncePublishDir is being added which will add a trailing backslash if not present and all ClickOnce specific targets will use this property.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested with ClickOnce publish through VS and CLI (with both with and without trailing backslash in property value) across all supported configuration\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
