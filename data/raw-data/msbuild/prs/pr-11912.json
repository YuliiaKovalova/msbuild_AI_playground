  "body": "This PR ensures that the `VisualStudio.ChannelName` value in the `.vsts-dotnet.yml` file remains set to `'int.main'` for the main branch, as it was before PR #11907.\n\n## Changes Made\n- Added a comment to line 122 to explicitly document that `'int.main'` is the correct value for the main branch\n- Preserved the existing value (`'int.main'`) instead of changing it to `'int.d17.14'`\n\n## Context\nPR #11907 attempts to merge changes from the vs17.14 branch (which has `'int.d17.14'` as the `VisualStudio.ChannelName` value) to the main branch. This PR ensures that when PR #11907 is merged, the `VisualStudio.ChannelName` value will remain `'int.main'` in the main branch.\n\nThis change maintains the correct VisualStudio channel configuration for the main branch builds.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
