  "title": "Update to assembly filtering in ClickOnce task for .NET Core scenario",
  "body": "**Context**\r\nIssue: \r\nClickOnce filters our assemblies that are part of the .NET Framework from publishing. This is done by looking up the assembly reference in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETFramework\\<version> folder. This works reliably for .NET FX scenarios. However for .NET Core, this check is not reliable. For a packages like System.ServiceModel.Primitives, the system.servicemodel and system.servicemodel.primitives assemblies get filtered out because they are present under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETCore but they are not present in .NET Core's runtime pack.\r\nThis will lead to app launch failure due to missing dependency.\r\n\r\n**Changes Made**\r\nFix ClickOnce's assembly filtering code for .net core to not filter copylocal assemblies even if the look up under C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETCore has succeeded.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nCTI has validated specific packages that are affected and also validated the change against top 50 NuGet packages.\r\n\r\n**Work Item**\r\nhttps://developercommunity2.visualstudio.com/t/ClickOnce-no-longer-works/1288425",
