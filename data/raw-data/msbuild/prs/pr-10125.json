  "title": "Remove redundant creation of Forwarding logger with NullLogger",
  "body": "### Context\r\nRandom discovery - we create NullLogger even when we have other logger(s) registered (e.g. ConsoleLogger, TerminalLogger ...).\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure that Projcet started and finished events are being transfered - we can 'hijack' the existing registration of ConfigurableLForwardingLogger for that - we just need to inspect and adjust existing registration\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nBuild with just the built-in loggers (TerminalLogger, ConsoleLogger, FileLogger) is probably the most common configuration - and we are injecting extra forwarder to each such a build - so while it's likely very small savings (as only couple events was redundantly de/serialized, rest was quickly skipped) - it applies very broadly.\r\n\r\n## Perf\r\n\r\nFollowing measurements were done using the OrchardCore and bootstrapped release MSBuild.exe with following 3 scenarios:\r\n* MSBuild.exe -m\r\n* MSBuild.exe -v:m -m\r\n* MSBuild.exe -tl -m\r\n\r\nEach scenario for each branch for 3 runs after the warmup run. Clean and kill of msbuild/dotnet/vbcscompiler processes between each individual runs. Median value choosed for each scenario.\r\n\r\nThe versions that has been tested were:\r\n* main (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/a8e224f80e753c4c52b6cc8a3a62c11780aff6d6)\r\n* Logging Svc fix (This PR)\r\n* Expanders refactor (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10102)\r\n\r\n\r\n|  | MSBuild.exe -m | MSBuild.exe -v:m -m  | MSBuild.exe -tl -m\r\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\r\n| Main                       | 00:00:36.02 | 00:00:31.86 | 00:00:33.22 |\r\n| Logging Svc fix       | 00:00:35.57 | 00:00:30.89 | 00:00:33.79 | \r\n| Expanders refactor | 00:00:36.66 | 00:00:32.43 | 00:00:32.49 |\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nPre-existing tests",
