  "body": "Backporting of https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11353\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nBuildCheck can still emit some LogBuildEvent(s) after ProjectFinishedEventArgs was reported and entries from _projectFileMap were cleaned up.\r\nDue to GetAndVerifyProjectFileFromContext validation, these checks break the build for the middle/large size projects.\r\nIt was discovered on the attempt to dogfood BuildCheck. \r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nIf BuildCheck is enabled, _projectFileMap won't be cleaned up.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\nFailure of the build in buildcheck is enabled (for middle and large project sizes).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nLocal testing with the patched msbuild.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\nlow: the feature is disabled by default and we need this fix to drive adaptation across dotnet org.\r\n\r\n",
