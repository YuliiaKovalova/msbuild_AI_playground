  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/7561\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/project-system/pull/7432 added a design-time target called CollectSuggestedWorkloads to https://github.com/project-system/blob/main/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Managed/ProjectSystem/DesignTimeTargets/Microsoft.Managed.DesignTime.targets. Unfortunately, that change did not account for the fact that this design-time targets file is used by non-SDK projects or projects using earlier SDKs. Such projects now fail with the error: The target \"GetSuggestedWorkloads\" does not exist in the project.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/project-system/pull/7553 temporarily worked around this by conditioning CollectSuggestedWorkloads on SDK projects with MissingWorkloadPacks. The correct fix is to move the dummy target (CollectSuggestedWorkloads) to Microsoft.Common.targets. That would also avoid bugs like https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/7561 in which a project that doesn't include the design-time targets fails because the CollectSuggestedWorkloads design-time target cannot be found.\r\n\r\nHowever, defining a dummy CollectSuggestedWorkloads in Microsoft.Common.targets would break the workload functionality for SDK projects because the SDK workload targets https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/release/6.0.1xx/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.ImportWorkloads.targets are imported before Microsoft.Common.targets. The dummy target would therefore override the real target.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nDefine the dummy targets in Microsoft.Common.props as a workaround.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Opened a solution that uses global.json to pin to .NET 5 (VS.RPC.Contracts) and verified that design-time builds succeeded and no errors are displayed in the error list\r\n2. Create a new Windows Application Packaging Project and verified that design-time builds succeeded and no errors are displayed in the error list\r\n3. Opened a shared project (.shproj) and verified that no errors are displayed in the error list\r\n4. Opened a MAUI solution and verified that the suggested workloads are still correctly displayed to the user\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nPlease provide feedback on whether this approach is sensible work-around for these issues and if so, which branch to target.\r\nHere is the import tree for a console app for reference.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/643461/132057622-d80e7e60-ce15-4038-bba3-c21f332e252e.png)\r\n",
