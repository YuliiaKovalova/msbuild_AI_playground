From the errors, it looks like, with this change, Microsoft.IO.Redist is turned on for linux/mac, but it should make it more restrictive, not less.\r\n\r\nPossible things I can think of that at least might fix something:\r\nAdd parentheses\r\nAdd one of: == 'true', != 'false', or == 'false'\r\nReplace this preprocessor directive with something (static, presumably) that actually checks the OS, but I'm not sure (how) that would work.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?",
