Changes a codebase for an assembly version that should never be referenced to point to the version and location of the extant assembly.\r\n\r\nWe could further reduce risk by leaving the `16.0.0.0` `codeBase` entry if that's desired; I don't think it's necessary and I don't know how that assembly could ever get in place in VS2022.",
