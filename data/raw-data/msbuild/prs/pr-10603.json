  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nNow that https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/39573 has made it into VS, we can finally enable loading `Microsoft.DotNet.MSBuildSdkResolver` by assembly name, as opposed to file path, which makes it possible to use its NGEN image.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nRe-did #9439 which had to be reverted because of the problematic dependency on `Newtonsoft.Json`. The .NET SDK resolver does not depend on `Newtonsoft.Json` anymore. All the other pieces are already in place:\r\n- `Microsoft.DotNet.MSBuildSdkResolver` is NGENed, both for MSBuild.exe and for devenv.exe.\r\n- `devenv.exe.config` contains binding redirects analogous to what's added in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nExperimentally inserted into VS and verified that `Microsoft.DotNet.MSBuildSdkResolver` is no longer JITted, saving ~50-100 ms of MSBuild.exe startup time.",

Are we sure it's working?\r\n\r\nI have high confidence that JITting of `Microsoft.DotNet.MSBuildSdkResolver` is eliminated in MSBuild.exe invoked from the command line. Now for PerfDDRITs, the CLR_AdjustedMethodsJitted_Total_NonDevenv counter is not showing any JITting in the resolver, neither baseline nor target build. This may be because the scenarios that measure this counter don't really cover startup / first evaluation. Or there's something else at play. My memory is faint, but isn't SDK resolution (in VS only?) optimized by forwarding requests from worker nodes back to the central node?",
