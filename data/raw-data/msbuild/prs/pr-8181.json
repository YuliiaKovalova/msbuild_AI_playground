  "body": "Fixes #8177 \r\n\r\n### Context\r\nInadvertent whitespace in a .NET version string, for example, may be tricky for a customer to diagnose and can be trimmed with minimal performance and code complexity impacts.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nSimpleVersion.RemoveTrivia() trims whitespace before performing its other operations.\r\nNew tests in SimpleVersion_Tests.cs.\r\nUpdate source code documentation to reflect the change.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSimpleVersion_Tests run clean for both net472 and net7.0.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nAll string manipulation is done with Span, to preserve the goal of no heap allocations when parsing a version string.\r\n",
