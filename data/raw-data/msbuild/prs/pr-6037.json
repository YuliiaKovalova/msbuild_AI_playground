  "title": "Fix how ClickOnce handles developement dependency package references",
  "body": "Fixes #1257168\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nIssue: ClickOnce is currently publishing contents of Nuget packages that are marked as developement dependencies. These package references should be excluded by publishing providers.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nFilter out the development dependencies from the _DeploymentReferencePaths item group. The filtering happens by looking at the CopyToPublishDirectory attribute on ReferenceCopyLocalPaths group which is set to false for said packages.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nCTI has validated specific packages that are affected and also validated the change against top 50 NuGet packages.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
