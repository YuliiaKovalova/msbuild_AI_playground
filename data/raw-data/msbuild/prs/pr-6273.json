  "body": "## Customer Impact\r\nTrying to build a solution with MSBuild.exe that contains a web site project causes MSBuild.exe to crash. This only affects the command line but includes _dotnet build_. It requires a relative path in the solution file and we've received 2 customer reports so far.\r\n\r\nIn those cases, we would return \"C:\\foo\\http://localhost:8080\" as an absolute path and then crash msbuild.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nNew unit test added. We will reach out to manual test team and compat test team to find out if website projects are included in their matrix.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow, new code path has a `try...catch` and falls back to previous behavior.\r\n\r\n## Code Reviewers\r\n@Forgind @cdmihai @BenVillalobos \r\n\r\n## Description of fix\r\nPreviously a property in the MSBuild API would return a string containing an \"absolute path\" but did not expand path segments like `..\\`.  We changed the code to call `Path.GetFullPath()` to expand these segments but did not realize that in some contexts, Visual Studio stores URLs in field that we were expecting to see a relative path.  URLs contain characters that `Path.GetFullPath()` will throw a NotSupportedException for.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we're not calling `Path.GetFullPath()` if the specified path is a URL and placed the call to `Path.GetFullPath()` inside a `try...catch` to fall back to previous behavior if that call fails",

We're trying to just move a commit from main to a servicing branch in a way that makes it easy to tell what commits are in what branch.  So I cherry-picked the merged commit into a branch based on the servicing branch.  Is that right?",

Where's @rainersigwald Rainer Sigwald FTE when you need him!? \ud83d\ude06\r\n> \r\nYes, that is correct. Ideally, we would have merged into 16.9 first and let it flow automatically to master. This is messier, but we can have a merge commit into vs16.9 and let the merge commit flow to master or squash this, reset master to not have the commit, and take the squashed commit in master. The latter is cleanest, but the former is what I'd go for.\r\n\r\nAlso, since this is a servicing request, someone will have to fill out the servicing template. Would you mind doing that?\r\n",
