        "body": "From looking around quickly online, it sounds like the dev15 installation model is basically that if it isn't already installed, it should go find it and install it? I may not have be remembering or understanding this properly, but if you have an extension that doesn't follow that, and you tell your users to install it \"next to VS,\" then now that we've moved to 64-bit VS, we'd fail to find it, right? So I was adding that case to the list of probing paths as an option.\r\n\r\nThe positive side, then, is that it would enable that scenario. The only negative I can see is that it might take a very slightly longer time to probe before it fails.",
