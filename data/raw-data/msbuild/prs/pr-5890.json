  "title": "Binding redirect for Immutable upgrade; ngen in our context",
  "body": "This addresses two problems with #5879:\r\n\r\n1. Failures in VS RPS related to JITting at runtime. With no `ngenApplication` specified, our SCI got ngened in the context of the default VS application, which isn't `MSBuild.exe`. Then at runtime, it wasn't loaded because the MVID of the ngened assembly (VS's special optprof-augmented copy) didn't match the one located at runtime (the standard retail copy from our repo).\r\n2. Added binding redirects for SCI. If a task depended on having access to our copy of SCI at our old version, updating our version would cause it to fail to load. Add a binding redirect like `devenv.exe` and Roslyn assemblies have to pull that reference to our copy.",
