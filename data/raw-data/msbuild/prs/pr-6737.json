  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n#6381 added a check to run as part of CI builds which expects the `SYSTEM_PULLREQUEST_TARGETBRANCH` environment variable to exist. As a result, regular main builds which are not triggered by PRs are broken.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nAdded the new code behind an `if` so it runs only if the PR target branch is defined. Effectively this makes the check run only in PRs, which is by design.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nWill watch the next main build.\r\n",
