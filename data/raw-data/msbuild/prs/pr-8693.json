Unfortunately, it also introduced a new issue in which copying a file onto itself could often just delete the file instead of copying anything. Customers reported this issue.\r\n\r\nCustomer Impact\r\n\r\nProjects that copy a file onto itself using the Copy task without passing identical paths for source and destination instead delete the file without necessarily even logging an error.\r\n\r\nRegression?\r\nYes, from #8275.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manually tested that the repro described in #8684 no longer works.\r\n\r\nRisk\r\nMinimal (straight revert of the commit that caused the bug)\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Forgind <Forgind@users.noreply.github.com>",

          "message": "Emulate AssignProjectConfiguration behavior in graph construction (#8625)\n\nSummary\r\nThe for sln-based builds, the AssignProjectConfiguration task ends up using the Configuration and Platform defined in the sln rather than passing through the global properties from the referencing project or attempting to do dynamic platform negotiation. This change adds equivalent functionality to graph construction.\r\n\r\nA concrete scenario this fixes for graph-based builds using an sln file is that most csproj define the \"x86\" platform while most vcxproj define \"Win32\". Previously for a graph build, if the csproj referenced the vcxproj, the platform passed to vcxproj would be x86, not Win32. Even worse, the vcxproj would be an entry point anyway, so it would double-build with both x86 AND Win32, which leads to race conditions.\r\n\r\nCustomer Impact\r\nMicrosoft-internal customer using sln-based builds will be able to opt-into graph builds\r\n\r\nRegression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nManual validation in the customer repo, as well as added unit tests\r\n\r\nRisk\r\nLow. Graph builds are a less-used feature, and this adds parity to what non-graph builds and VS-based builds do. It's unlikely that any behavioral change would be impactful due to those other scenarios presumably working for customers who may be using graph builds.",
