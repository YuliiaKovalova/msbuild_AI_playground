  "body": "Part of #4779\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nMake Common props, targets and tasks easier to read and understand.\r\nMake Visual Studio's Property Page (_XAML_) Rules easier to read and understand.\r\n\r\nPart of the larger refactoring that'll lead into #1686\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n - Remove all trailing spaces\r\n - Fixup new lines where necessary\r\n   - Add new lines between every block to make it clear.\r\n   - Remove unnecessary new lines to reduce scrolling.\r\n - Adjust Indentation as per EditorConfig (**2-space**)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nI'll also make sure not to mess up the git blame too much.\r\nTo make reviewing easier, I had split up the changes logically rather than a file.\r\n\r\n**The commits by themselves are logical changes. So, if possible, rebase merge them to preserve file history view in Git.**\r\n\r\nAlso, please do note that these changes won't make much difference alone but with other formatting and refactors that follow this will make a world of difference in reading these files.",

After a few major versions, we take that archive's latest as base. And we'll do this over and over again._\r\n\r\nHence, having separated like this will make it easier for our archivists easier to clean up the commit tree. It'll also make it easier to blame and dig up historical commits easily and compare. Recently we also started using blame ignores to filter out the cosmetic commits.\r\n\r\n</details>",
