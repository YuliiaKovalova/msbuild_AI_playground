  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n`SuggestedBindingRedirectsCacheFile` is enough for the target to support building incrementally. The RAR cache file is an implementation detail and should not be used as an input because it leads to executing the target unnecessarily when it changes for reasons unrelated to binding redirects.\r\n\r\nAlso, there does not seem to be a reason for running this target as part of design-time builds.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Removed `ResolveAssemblyReferencesStateFile` from `GenerateBindingRedirects` inputs.\r\n- Added a design-time build condition to the target, same as what `_GenerateSuggestedBindingRedirectsCache` uses.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Verified that incremental and full build work as expected.\r\n- Experimentally inserted the change into VS.",
