  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nWhile writing a unit test I hit this exception and found the error message slightly misleading.\r\n\r\nThe `ProjectLoadSettings` enum does not contain a member named `RecordDuplicateImports`. This string appears to be referring to the `RecordDuplicateButNotCircularImports` member.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nChanged the content of the resource string.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nI've updated the XLF files manually to avoid a loc pass. Please verify that this is safe to do, and that the loc team doesn't have a shadow copy of these strings somewhere else that is considered the source of truth.",
