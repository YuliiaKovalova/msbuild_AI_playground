  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9769\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThe calculation of project type during Project Graph construction happens four times per project instance when instead it could be calculated once and the value re-used.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThe `ProjectGraphNode` constructor now calculates the value for \"project type\" and stores it with an internal property that is read when constructing the graph.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUpdated unit tests which were checking this value.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nI got rid of all the helper methods and replaced them with simple checks like `ProjectType == ProjectType.OuterBuild` because these helpers aren't really necessary for simple checks like the value of an enum.",
