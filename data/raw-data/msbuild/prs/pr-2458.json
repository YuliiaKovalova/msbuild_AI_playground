  "body": "Fixes #1785 with backward compatibility by accepting a) the current return format of `GetTargetFrameworkProperties`, or b) a new format that consists of a single item with metadata, like\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ProjectBuildInstructions Include=\"$(MSBuildThisFileFullPath)\">\r\n  <DesiredTargetFrameworkProperties>TargetFramework=$(NearestTargetFramework)</DesiredTargetFrameworkProperties>\r\n  <HasSingleTargetFramework>$(_HasSingleTargetFramework)</HasSingleTargetFramework>\r\n  <IsRidAgnostic>$(_IsRidAgnostic)</IsRidAgnostic>\r\n</ProjectBuildInstructions>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had to do some tricks to keep backward compatibility with the old semicolon-delimited return value, but I think that's a hard requirement, because it'll be possible to use the MSBuild 15.5 engine with SDK 2.0.0, which will still emit the old value.\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't directly improve things much, except in the case of building a single project with many ProjectReferences in a multiproc MSBuild environment. But I think this is a good foundation for building a fix for #1276 on top of.",

This allows a single build request to be sent to the\nengine, and allows resolving references in parallel on multiprocess\nbuilds.",
