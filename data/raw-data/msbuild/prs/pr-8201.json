  "body": "Fixes #8196\r\n\r\nWork item (Internal use): [AB#1680332](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1680332)\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nCommit 789fa9a8d changed the `CleanPublishFolder` target to remove PublishDir unconditionally. The previous condition removed the dir only if it was set to `$OutputPath\\app.publish`.\r\n\r\nUsers override `PublishDir` to custom paths and don't expect their publish dir to be deleted during clean. The change broke that behavior. \r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers who customize `$(PublishDir)` to a central location (not uncommon, but not default) encounter build breaks on `Rebuild`, because each project tries to delete the same directory.\r\n\r\nOther users will be confused because `Clean` deletes more than it used to.\r\n\r\nMultiple customer reports on GitHub and via VS Feedback. A workaround exists that can be applied to a repo, but it is inconvenient.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, from VS 17.3/SDK 6.0.400.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nManual testing + confirmation of workaround from customers (the workaround is basically identical to this change).\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow: reversion to the behavior from a release ago.",
