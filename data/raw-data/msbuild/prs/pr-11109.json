  "title": "Make private runtime-only dependencies on .NET Standard 2.0.",
  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nSince #6148 we produce only reference assemblies for .NET Standard 2.0, which means that several of the our NuGet packages' dependencies when targeting .NET Standard 2.0 are unused.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nThe project files for `Microsoft.Build.Framework`, `Utilities.Core` and `Tasks` were updated to apply `PrivateAssets=\"all\"` to all package references that are not exposed in the package's public API, when targeting .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI ran `dotnet pack` on these projects and validated manually that on .NET Standard 2.0, `Microsoft.Build.Framework` has zero dependencies, `Utilities.Core` depends only on `Framework`, and `Tasks` depends only on the previous two.\r\n\r\nBecause Roslyn [keeps some internal APIs in reference assemblies](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/refout.md#definition-of-ref-assemblies), these reference assemblies still reference some assemblies whose respective package is not depended upon. I manually validated with ILSpy that the types in these assemblies are used only by internal APIs.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a (minor) source-breaking change if a .NET Standard 2.0 project uses APIs from on one of the removed packages and transitively depended on it. They will have to directly depend on them, and it's not the first time we do a change like this (#9055).\r\n\r\nI don't think that this is a binary-breaking change because the .NET Standard 2.0 binaries are not being used at runtime.",
