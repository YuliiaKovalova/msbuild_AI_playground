By default, all these tasks should behave the same with respect to DTD processing.\r\n2. Backward compatibility. Unless we are 100% sure that the previous setting was useless, there should be a way for users to bring it back if they depend on it.\r\n\r\nIn spirit of 2., is it safe to unconditionally change the behavior when loading namespaces (in `XmlPeek` and `XmlPoke`) and XSLT parameters (in `XsltTransform`)?",

Unless we are 100% sure that the previous setting was useless, there should be a way for users to bring it back if they depend on it.\r\n\r\nThe classic msbuild 'gotcha'. It's public so _theoretically_ tons of devs could be using it, but we have no way to tell and should assume worst case scenario and provide an opt-into original behavior. Giving XmlPoke and XslTransformation a public `ProhibitDtd` boolean (defaulted to true) is a good idea in that respect.\r\n\r\nSo to directly answer this:\r\n> Do I also have to make changes similar to this in these files so the value is picked up based on what's set on the property?\r\nDtdProcessing = prohibitDtd ? DtdProcessing.Prohibit : DtdProcessing.Ignore\r\n\r\nYep! Each class should have the `ProhibitDtd` boolean and have them set DtdProcessing to either Prohibit or Ignore based on that boolean.",
