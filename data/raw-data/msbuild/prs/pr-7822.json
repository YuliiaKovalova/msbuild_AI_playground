  "title": "Remove references to System.Private.Uri",
  "body": "System.Private.Uri 6.0.0 is reported as a prebuilt in source-build due to these references. This fix is similar to https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/26448.\r\n\r\nI tested this change in a source-build tarball context and verified the prebuilt package is no longer getting pulled. I also made sure msbuild builds with `./build.sh`.\r\n\r\nI noticed that these were introduced due to some CG concerns (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/20cdf6ff1f617fc6d486c170dff95df0300676e3), so if this change causes issues for the MSBuild build, then these System.Private.Uri and System.Runtime references can be conditioned out for source-build instead.",
