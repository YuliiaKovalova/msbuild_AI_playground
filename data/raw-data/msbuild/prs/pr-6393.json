  "body": "~~Based on #6350 for convenience. That PR centralized the cache deserialization logic for StateFileBase, so it would be easy to accidentally overwrite this change with that one when resolving merge conflicts.~~\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThe precomputed cache from https://github.com/dotnet/installer/pull/10037 lives in Program Files after it's installed on a new computer. Program Files can only be accessed with admin privileges, which not all users have and those that have generally wouldn't expect. This permits reading the precomputed cache even without admin rights.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nSwitch how the file is read.",

I'll switch it to be based off of master, which should clean up the diff here, but when we merge the other one, there'll be a merge conflict, and we need to make sure to not do the obvious thing of \"method was deleted --> delete change, too\" and instead integrate the change into StateFileBase as I did here.",
