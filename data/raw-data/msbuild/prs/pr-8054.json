There are some cases in which we put sensitive information in temp and assume it's fine because on Windows, it is. This doesn't actually fix that assumption, since we're currently waiting for a new API that will be introduced in .NET 7 that will make a folder with appropriate permissions. However, this PR changes all the issues Eric Erhardt identified such that they go through a single code path, so to fix the security issue afterwards just requires changing the one place in our code.\n\nIt did occur to me that we may not be able to use that API, in which case I can just write something to make a folder with a random name under temp then tweak its permissions.",

This causes a run-time bind failure when the library is used by a 3.1 app, for example.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nThe package is being picked up MessagePack which targets netstandard2.0. The issue [blocks it from updating to a newer version of the library](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp/pull/1515).\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, this regressed in 17.3.0. Only the initial version of the package was correct.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nBuilt the package locally and inspected its contents.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis pull request uses a [documented workaround](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#advanced-extension-points-to-create-customized-package).\r\n\r\nPackage contents without the fix:\r\n```\r\n/lib\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n/ref\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n    netstandard2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nPackage contents with the fix:\r\n```\r\n/lib\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n    netstandard2.0\r\n/ref\r\n    net35\r\n    net472\r\n    net7.0\r\n    netstandard2.0\r\n```",
