  "body": "Fixes #5898\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nExecuting projects changes the cwd, which makes relative paths behave unexpectedly. So when an implicit restore happens (`/restore`), then the cwd is different than what it was originally. For non-graph builds, this isn't a problem as the `BuildRequestData` gets the full path of the project file before the implicit restore, so there effectively are no relative paths to deal with. However, this was not the case for `GraphBuildRequestData`, so doing a build with `/retore`, `/graph`, and a relative path to a project file was erroring incorrectly.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThe `ProjectGraphEntryPoint` constructor will now get the full path of the project file, similar to what `BuildRequestData` does today.\r\n\r\nI also followed all uses of `ProjectGraphEntryPoint.ProjectFile` and removed any normalization since it's now always done already.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI tested this change calling msbuild on a relative path with graph on/off and restore on/off. It now behaves as expected.",
