This can lead to incorrect versions of assemblies being found as finding the AnyCPU version of an assembly instead of the windows-specific version.\r\n\r\nChanges Made\r\nUse AssemblyDependencyResolver as a second pass (after looking for \"well-known assemblies\") to automatically use the deps.json file to find the right assembly.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\nVerified that for a task assembly with a rid-specific dependency, it finds the rid-specific dependency as specified by the deps.json file. Also verified that it can find native assemblies and that the issue that inspired this (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/23498) no longer reproduces after giving nuget a .deps.json file specifying the correct version.",
