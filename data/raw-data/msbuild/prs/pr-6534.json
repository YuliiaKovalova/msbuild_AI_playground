With these two, users should have all the information they require to mix and match all the version components they want: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2255729/121096959-0ce99580-c7a8-11eb-8b71-19e73e1132fb.png)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUpdated version test.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nTargeting 16.11 as it only adds new stuff that should not break. Caveat is if users define the new built-in properties. We'll break those users. Though I think those users don't exist :)",
