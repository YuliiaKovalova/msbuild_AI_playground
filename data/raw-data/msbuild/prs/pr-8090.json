  "body": "Fixes #6607\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nMSBuild theoretically defines the VSToolsPath property in its app.config/app.amd.config files, but it doesn't actually fire in practice. (You can tell since two of the properties next to it were pulled out and properly defined elsewhere, and that didn't cause \"duplicate definition\" errors.)\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nMove both the VSToolsPath and the MSBuildExtensionsPath64 out of the condition and give them proper values. I did have to hardcode 17.0, but that is done in several other places, so I think it appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI tried the provided repro before and after this change. This made it not happen anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso added a unit test.\r\n",
