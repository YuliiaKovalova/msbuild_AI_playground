  "title": "Allow proxying targets back to the original target",
  "body": "Fixes #9117\r\n\r\nFor project cache plugins to only partially handle a build request, it makes sense that it proxy some targets back to the original targets. For example, in VS the build request has:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"Build\"\r\n\"BuiltProjectOutputGroup\"\r\n\"BuiltProjectOutputGroupDependencies\"\r\n\"DebugSymbolsProjectOutputGroup\"\r\n\"DebugSymbolsProjectOutputGroupDependencies\"\r\n\"DocumentationProjectOutputGroup\"\r\n\"DocumentationProjectOutputGroupDependencies\"\r\n\"SatelliteDllsProjectOutputGroup\"\r\n\"SatelliteDllsProjectOutputGroupDependencies\"\r\n\"SGenFilesOutputGroup\"\r\n\"SGenFilesOutputGroupDependencies\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Build\" is the only relevant one that a plugin would want to handle, while the rest are \"information gathering\" targets which should just be passed through.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes an exception that gets thrown when attempting to proxy targets back to themselves.",

        "body": "An alternative idea would actually be to change the scenario a little bit. Instead of the plugin being expected to provide proxy targets for all targets in the request, it could just return the ones it did something about and the rest are implicitly \"passed through\". Today the proxy targets replace the targets in the request, so this would be more of a merge.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nOriginal request: `Build, BuiltProjectOutputGroup, BuiltProjectOutputGroupDependencies, ...`\r\nCache plugin returns proxy targets `Build -> GetTargetPath`, and nothing more.\r\nNew request: `GetTargetPath, BuiltProjectOutputGroup, BuiltProjectOutputGroupDependencies, ...`\r\n\r\nHere's what the alternate implementation would look like: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/main...dfederm:msbuild:proxy-targets-fill-missing\r\n\r\nI actually kinda like that a bit better since the plugin cannot drop targets entirely, making the caller confused about results for a target they requested being just plain missing.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
