This is when I made the SBRP suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf this branch is flowing to 9.0 sdk then yes this is going to be a problem.  The two referenced precedents should not be followed.  The two referenced precedents look like flow mistakes. I will work to correct these.  If you take a dependency on 10 SBRP in a component that flows to an earlier sdk it has the potential to break source-build.   It will cause problems when packages are being referenced from the newer SBRP version but not the older SBRP version.  Instead of using SBRP, you would need to declare a darc dependendency on System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource so that the \"live\" version is used.\r\n\r\ncc @dotnet/source-build for visibility.",

Plus I'm bit confused on how to handle the SHA - should it somehow flow automatically eventually, or do we need to add this manually ourselves (e.g by finding the latest commit fro that lib in release/9.0 - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/release/9.0/src/libraries/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src - which would be [981a85989d49daee6b2147113b7de639f5e5d903](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/981a85989d49daee6b2147113b7de639f5e5d903)?)",
