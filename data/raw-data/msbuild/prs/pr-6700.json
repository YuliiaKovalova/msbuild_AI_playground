  "body": "Fixes #6152\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nBuildEventArgs.ThreadId doesn't seem used or particularly useful. We're thinking of deprecating it for 17.0.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nReturn 0 for ThreadId instead of a real value.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nI changed the comment to indicate that it's deprecated. Is there another way I should indicate that? Looking through our repo, the only references to deprecated things were in comments, tests, .targets, and a single string resource.",

If a lot of people actually use it, we'd presumably revert this.",
