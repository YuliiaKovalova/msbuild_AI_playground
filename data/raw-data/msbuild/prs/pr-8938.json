  "body": "Fixes #8784\r\n\r\nCredit for finding the issue with serialization: @rokonec \r\n\r\n### Context\r\nAssemblyLoad log messages were appearing in the VS output window based on file logger verbosity\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nAssemblyLoadBuildEventArgs  were not de/serializing it's `Importance`. The default value is `High`. So if another logger was consuming LowImportnace messages - including AssemblyLoadBuildEventArgs , then those were in multiprocess build transfered to main node, where their `Importance` jumped to `High` - and hence they got consumed by other loggers with lower verbosity (including VS output).",
