  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of introducing the type seems to have been silencing a legacy code analyzer rule. The rule does not exist anymore / has not been brought over to Roslyn (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/722) and it's now hurting performance, if anything. Types like `HashSet<int>` are part of the mscorlib native image and it's wasteful to duplicate the code in our binaries. The rest is handled by IBC/OptProf.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\nDeleted NGen<T> and its uses.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nExperimental insertion to confirm no regressions.\r\n",
