  "title": "Fix Bootstrap Build",
  "body": "Fixes #6289\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n#6126 changes the way that `NuGet.Frameworks.dll` is loaded to be used by `NuGetFrameworkWrapper` from a call to `LoadFile` to a call to `LoadFrom.  The path passed in to the `Load*` call is the same in both cases, but the behavior is different when running on .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nOn .NET Framework, calling `LoadFile` results in IJW loading rules being followed, and a different copy of `NuGet.Frameworks.dll` \r\n than the one requested being loaded.  It also appears to match the one loaded into the LOAD context.  Calling `LoadFrom` results in the specified assembly being loaded, but it doesn't match the copy of the assembly loaded into the LOAD context.  Thus, it remains in the LOADFROM context instead of being promoted to the LOAD context.\r\n\r\nLater on, there is a collision between code from the two instances of `NuGet.Frameworks.dll` that are loaded into the LOAD context and the LOADFROM context, and this is where the `MissingMethodException` is thrown.\r\n\r\nNote, this does not happen on the .NET Core bootstrap build because the loader behavior is significantly simpler.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nChoose the `Load*` API based on the target framework at build time.  On .NET Core, use `LoadFrom` and on .NET Framework, use `LoadFile`.  This type of precedent already exists in MSBuild where there is different load behavior for .NET Framework and .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested local bootstrap builds that were built on .NET Framework and .NET Core using the repro in #6289.",
