The bug was reported by external customers.\n\nRegression?\n\nYes, caused by #6151 where glob matching was optimized which internally made it take a different code path.\n\nChanges Made\n\nFixes the regression by properly handling `*.*` to mean all files, not just files with a dot in the name. This convention is used in .NET APIs on all platforms and matches the pre-regression behavior.\n\nTesting\n\nAdded unit test coverage. Also verified locally with the repro provided by the original bug reporter.\n\nRisk\n\nLow. The star patterns are special-cased to mean all files, other patterns are unaffected.",
