        "body": "I don't know how recently solution filters got in, but for context, source-build doesn't actually have to build a new version using a *significantly* older version. We'll build source-build 6.0.100 with a prebuilt copy of 6.0.100, then 6.0.101 builds using 6.0.100. Eventually we hope to be able to build e.g. 6.0.200 using 6.0.1XX (depends on having good enough infra for it to be feasible to maintain multiple feature bands), but that's the biggest type of gap we'd like people to keep in mind for now.",
