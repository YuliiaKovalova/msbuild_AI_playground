  "body": "\r\n\r\nFixes #8394 \r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThis is mainly so that the static graph-based restore can detect that the user enabled the binary logger so it can automatically provide a binary log for restore which is run out-of-proc so it has to be another file.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\nThis sets `MSBUILDBINARYLOGGERENABLED=true` when the binary logger is enabled.  I originally tried to have a new property on the `EngineServices` but that doesn't work for out-of-proc nodes.  To make that work, each out-of-proc node would need to be told if the binary logger is in use for that particular build which seems like a lot overhead compared to just setting an environment variable.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nBuilt locally and ran the bootstrap MSBuild to verify the environment variable is set.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n",
