  "body": "[**Example**](https://github.com/JaneySprings/PathBug)\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\nI am creating an VSCode extension that allow debug .NET MAUI apps. I use Microsoft.Build NuGet to get the path to output directory (OutputPath property). \r\nI noticed that on Linux, when running from NodeJS, msbuild outputs a path containing an incorrect directory separation char ' \\\\ '.\r\n<img width=\"269\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48021947/211402099-44c0ccf8-347b-4252-a04f-66ea61992a79.png\">\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nYou can take my example above and execute run.sh (don't forget to change the path to MSBuild.dll in the netapp/Program.cs file on your)\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\ndotnet 7.0.100\r\nUbuntu 22.04 (ARM64)\r\nNodeJS latest\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is an MSBuild or DotNet bug, but maybe you can help me understand what is the reason for this behavior",

Should we regard it as a 'smell' to manually construct paths? If we did start using `Path.Combine` in more places, would tools like the structured log viewer be able to understand the changes in paths across logs taken from different operating systems?",
