  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nThe same doc comment text currently exists in two places, in the docs repo https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs, and in MSBuild source here in this repo. These are out of sync, with updates having happened in both places. \r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nIn email, @rainersigwald and others agreed that we should change the doc build process to build from doc comments in MSBuild sources. Before we turn that on, though, we need a one-time migration of doc comment updates that we made in the docs repo. I will be preparing a PR for this work.\r\n",
