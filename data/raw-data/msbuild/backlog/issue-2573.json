  "title": "Replace short-lived string, collection, enumerator allocations with String Segment, Struct-based collection/enumerator",
  "body": "MSBuild performs huge amount of short-lived string, collection and enumerator allocations. For large projects, this produces huge amount of memory pressure in the thousands of megabytes during evaluation. We should replace usage with smarter patterns such as a StringSegment + struct enumerator.\r\n\r\nUsing this bug to track the places that I see could benefit from this as I look through traces:\r\n\r\n- [x] ExpressionShredder.SplitSemiColonSeparatedList and consumers of it, producing lots of string, List<string> and boxed Enumerator<string> instances. #2586\r\n- [x] ProjectXmlElements.GetChildElements produces unneeded List<string> and a XmlChildEnumerator, just make a strongly typed enumerator (2%) - https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/2577",
