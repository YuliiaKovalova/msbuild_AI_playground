If a build was started by the MSBuild task, it would indeed be useful to have the task ID of that parent MSBuild task.\r\n\r\n@MarkKharitonov I'm guessing at this point you have the most knowledge of us all about this problem. Would you consider preparing a PR that implements your proposal? This way you could test and see if it solves your problem. ",
