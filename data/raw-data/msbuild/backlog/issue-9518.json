  "title": "Breaking change for BinaryLogReplayEventSource 17.8 -> 17.10 ",
  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n17.8 introduced (via #9132):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// Raised once <see cref=\"BuildEventArgsReader\"/> is created during replaying\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        public event Action<IBuildEventArgsReaderNotifications>? NotificationsSourceCreated;\r\n```\r\n\r\non `BinaryLogReplayEventSource` (directly)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n        /// <summary>\r\n        /// An event that allows the caller to be notified when a string is encountered in the binary log.\r\n        /// BinaryReader passed in ctor is at the beginning of the string at this point.\r\n        /// </summary>\r\n        public event Action? StringEncountered;\r\n```\r\n\r\non `BinaryLogReplayEventSource` and `BuildEventArgsReader` (via `IBuildEventArgsReaderNotifications`) interface.\r\n\r\n**Both of those methods are removed in 17.10** (with #9307)\r\n\r\n### How to fix\r\nBoth methods were retired and replaced with more usable API. Below are the suggested replacements:\r\n\r\n * `StringEncountered` - use the richer `StringReadDone` intorduced on the same interface\r\n * `NotificationsSourceCreated` - If you need the  call the `BuildEventArgsReader` created by `BinaryLogReplayEventSource.Replay`  call - do not call the `Replay` overload taking the path or stream arguments, but instead call the `BinaryLogReplayEventSource.OpenBuildEventsReader` explicitly - that way you will obtain the reader (previously returned via the event), then you can pass the returned reader to `BinaryLogReplayEventSource.Replay` overload.",
