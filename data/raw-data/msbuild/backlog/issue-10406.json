  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nrelated #10398 \r\n\r\nMSBuild evaluator has so called 'fast path' for the property functions evaluation: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/9045cf7e62f95112a7f459427475809846e0a795/src/Build/Evaluation/Expander.cs#L3684\r\nNot being on the fast path means a fallback to a reflection need which makes the call more expensive. We should make sure that for common usage patterns (creating/building/publishing new console/web app) do not need any property functions that are not on the 'fast path'\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nIntegration test(s) in dotnet/sdk repo (we need it there to catch the regressions early on) that turns on [`MSBuildLogPropertyFunctionsRequiringReflection=true`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adotnet%2Fmsbuild%20LogPropertyFunctionsRequiringReflection&type=code) and verifies that no functions are being required.\r\nWe should be able to use `DotnetNewCommand` and `DotnetBuildCommand` to auther the test(s). Inspiration:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/18985b172e4ed14fa4bb5c2056eae9c65bdac538/test/dotnet-new.Tests/WebProjectsTests.cs#L36-L67\r\n",
