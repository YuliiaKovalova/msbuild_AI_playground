I am sure there are more than just the list above.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to try and have an \"escape hatch\", historically this would have been something like a Registry key, however with the transition into a more platform agnostic MSBuild this probably has fallen out of favor. What is the best possible solution that gives people the ability to register themselves as an `SolutionProjectType.KnownToBeMSBuildFormat` short of making the if check any longer?",
