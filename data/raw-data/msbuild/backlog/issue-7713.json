  "body": "## What I wanted to do\r\nSubmit a PR to MSBuild.\r\n\r\n## What I did\r\nI read the [MSBuild Contributing Code](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/3db83fdeb160404917b6bd3f4dd9e62338539a48/documentation/wiki/Contributing-Code.md) documentation.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\nThat document states\r\n\r\n> You must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting your pull request. To complete the CLA, submit a request via the form and electronically sign the CLA when you receive the email containing the link to the document. [...]\r\n\r\nI interpret this as \"before you submit a PR, complete the CLA signing process\". But \"the form\" is plain text, so I don't know how to sign the CLA.\r\n\r\nThe [CLA Homepage](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/) states\r\n\r\n>  When you contribute to a Microsoft open source project on GitHub with a new pull request, a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on the pull request, including a link to this system to accept the agreement.\r\n\r\nI interpret this as \"first submit a PR, then the bot will refer you to the form\".\r\n\r\nPlease clarify this piece of documentation so that it is easier to contribute to MSBuild.",
