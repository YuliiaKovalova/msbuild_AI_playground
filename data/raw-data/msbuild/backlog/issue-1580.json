  "body": "From internal mail:\r\n\r\nI got an OOM today building the VSO repository with a Dev15 32-bit MSBuild. This surprised me, so I checked for the LARGEADDRESSAWARE bit in the headers. This lets the process use 4 GB of VM on a 64-bit machine. It was missing in the 15.0 MSBuild.exe but present in the 14.0 version, so this is a regression.\r\n\r\nX:\\>dumpbin /headers \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\"\r\nMicrosoft (R) COFF/PE Dumper Version 14.00.24210.0\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
