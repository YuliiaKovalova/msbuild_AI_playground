You can however install a [specific older version of VS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/history#installing-an-earlier-release) if you need to downgrade. \r\n\r\nWithout logs the issue is proving difficult to debug. Could you [share a binary log](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/Providing-Binary-Logs.md) of your build?

For some sort of investigation, we'd need to see a before/after binlog. Since you have company policy to consider, you can [file a feedback ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/8/index.html) with the binlog attached. Attaching it in a feedback ticket would make it confidential to us.\r\n\r\nClosing the issue for now. If this is still an issue and you want to reopen it, I suggest filing the feedback ticket and referencing this issue so it can get routed to this team quicker.",
