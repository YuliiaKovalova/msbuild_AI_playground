  "title": "MSBuild Out of Memory Error when run from Jenkins",
  "body": "Hello. I've been running into this problem for the last couple days on a project I'm working on and can now reliably reproduce it.\r\n\r\nWe have a jenkins machine setup to build a Visual Studio solution. The solution is generated from CMake and has about 2 dozen projects in it. The build takes about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nI wanted to speed it up so I added the /m[axcpucount] option. The machine has 6 CPUs. Running MSBuild on the machine directly or through SSH with the /m flag works fine and the build is faster. For some reason, running the command from Jenkins causes the machine to continuously spawn MSBuild.exe or MSBuild.dll* processes which eventually causes Windows to run out of memory.\r\n\r\nI really don't understand why this is the case from Jenkins but it doesn't happen when running MSBuild on the machine directly in DOS, MSBuild console or MSYS2 (which is how I'm connecting over SSH).\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen similar behavior or have an idea what might be the culprit?\r\n\r\nThis is with a setting of /m:3\r\n\r\n![msbuild_spam](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31298292/41696155-77004252-74c7-11e8-8b02-c16f0258c506.png)\r\n\r\nThe command jenkins was running is \r\n`cmd.exe /C \" chcp 1252 && \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\" /m:3 C:\\Path\\to\\Solution.sln`\r\n\r\n> The output is:\r\n> Active code page: 1252\r\n> Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 14.0.25420.1\r\n> Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

When running MSBuild on the machine directly though it continues and builds the rest of the solution.\r\n\r\nAny help here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
