  "body": "Been looking to add `/warnaserror` to Roslyn and one suggestion was to just set it globally using the MSBuild property `<WarningsAsErrors>`.  The [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb629394.aspx) for that property seems incomplete:\r\n\r\n> Specifies a list of warnings to treat as errors. This parameter is equivalent to the /warnaserror compiler switch.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of `/warnaserror` without any other argument is to create an error for every warning.  Setting an empty property would not have the same effect, same as not having one.  \r\n\r\nHow can I use `<WarningsAsErrors>` property version to create an error for every warning? ",
