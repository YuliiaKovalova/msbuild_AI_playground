The last target definition wins, so the one you create is overwritten by the default, empty, one.\r\n\r\nInstead, you should create a new target that runs at the appropriate time by using BeforeTargets:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"MessageBeforePublish\" BeforeTargets=\"BeforePublish\">\r\n  <Message Text=\"BeforePublish\" Importance=\"high\" />\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose docs are extremely misleading. I don't know why they were added. @ghogen think we can make an improvement here? Ideally we'd have a list of \"common targets you can hook onto\" but not mention redefining.",
