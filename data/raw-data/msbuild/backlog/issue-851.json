  "body": "I've got a problem that would benefit from the ability to define an \"ur-target\" (a target which would execute if no named target matches the target passed at the command line) and the ability to reflect over the current target (e.g. MSBuildTarget). \n\nMy project defines a \"tree of platforms\" and, given a platform that represents a node in the tree, will recursively walk the tree and, upon reaching a leaf, will execute a target against one of the projects types I am aggregating. I implement this by including a different target files depending on the type of platform. For platforms representing nodes in the tree I include a \"stubs targets file\" which defines stub targets for a set of well known targets (e.g. Build, Clean, Rebuild, Compile, etc) which implement the recursive step. For platforms representing leaves I include the targets file for the aggregated platform. The problem is the \"stubs targets file\" needs a stub target for all possible targets and it's there I'd like to define an ur-target.\n\nFor example, if I am aggregating Android, iOS and Windows mobile projects, then I would define a platform \"mobile\" which would be the root of a tree with three leafs -- one for each aggregated project. When I pass `/p:platform=mobile /t:build` then all three sub projects build. Similarly, when I pass `/p:platform=mobile /t:clean` all three projects are cleaned. Each target requires a stub that preforms the recursion and I'd like to replace all those targets with the ur target.\n\nOne possible implementation might be to have a reserved target name, say `*`. Then I could write something like the following:\n\n```\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <ProjPath>$(MSBuildProjectFullPath)</ProjPath>\n    <CurTarget>$(MSBuildTarget)</CurTarget>\n</PropertyGroup>\n\n<Target Name=\"*\" Condition=\"'$(Platform)'=='mobile' >\n    <MSBuild Projects=\"$(ProjPath)\" Properties=\"platform=ios\" Targets=\"$(CurTarget)\" />\n    <MSBuild Projects=\"$(ProjPath)\" Properties=\"platform=android\" Targets=\"$(CurTarget)\" />\n    <MSBuild Projects=\"$(ProjPath)\" Properties=\"platform=windows\" Targets=\"$(CurTarget)\" />\n</Target>\n```\n\nWarm regards,\nChris\n",
