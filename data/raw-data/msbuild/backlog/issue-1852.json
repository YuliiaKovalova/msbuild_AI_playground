  "title": "Suggestion: Define property \"if not defined\" shortcut",
  "body": "In writing custom build scripts I often find myself writing \"default\" property values in shared files using the following pattern:\r\n`<MyProperty Condition=\"'$(MyProperty)' == ''\">TheDefaultValue</MyProperty>`\r\n\r\nThe intent being that other scripts can override the default by defining their own `<MyProperty>`.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if MSBuild provided a built-in shortcut for this pattern, that was easier to read and write, there is a lot of syntax crammed into that Condition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be possible to repurpose the \"Exists\" condition so you could write:\r\n`<MyProperty Condition=\"!Exists\">`\r\n\r\nWhere \"Exists\" has special meaning when provided no argument, that it will check if the current Property is already defined.\r\n\r\nOr  maybe a new condition altogether that worked for properties.\r\n`<MyProperty Condition=\"!Defined\">TheDefaultValue</MyProperty>`\r\n\r\nIn this case, you could have Defined without arguments indicate if the _current_ property was defined. Or you could pass an argument to check if a different property was defined.\r\n\r\nI admit that this is a minor gripe, but it would make scripts a bit easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n",
