  "body": "My understanding is, that Microsoft requires (maybe not enforcing yet) that both the digest and timestamp digest are SHA256 to be a valid Authenticode SHA-2 signature on Windows 10 as of May 2017.\r\n\r\nThe current `SignFile` task is not able to produce such signature, but produces a signature with SHA256 file digest, but SHA1 timestamp digest.\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\nIn my opinion `SignFile` should use RFC 3161 SHA256 timestamp (`/td SHA256 /tr <RFC3161-timestamp-url>`) when signing, or at least support it.\r\n\r\n**Actual**\r\nCurrently the when using `SignFile` to sign with SHA256 digest (TargetFrameworkVersion >= v4.5), it only supports using SHA1 digest for the timestamp. (it uses `/t <timestamp-url>`).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/a9f64ebd108702c3fc65339c66cb124217854524/src/Tasks/ManifestUtil/SecurityUtil.cs#L755-L756\r\n\r\n**Dual signing**\r\nIt would also be really nice to be able to dual sign, which would require the `/as` signtool parameter\r\n",

        "body": "Agree with this request, we use timestamped signatures on our applications and installers, and there are some security personnel out there who will raise a red flag at the sight of the letters \"sha1\", no matter how insignificant. Given that signtool.exe already supports this and MSBuild is doing P/Invoke of Win32 API, it should be possible to achieve. Not sure if it should be linked to the existing SHA1-vs-SHA256 flag for the signature itself?\r\n\r\nAs long as we're at it, Authenticode sealing (see e.g. https://vcsjones.com/2016/12/30/authenticode-sealing/) would also be a useful addition.",
