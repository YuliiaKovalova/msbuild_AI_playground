  "title": "[Feature Request]: Tasks - Support moving directories in the Move Task",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nMSBuild doesn't directly provide for moving a directory.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nBuild scripts sometimes need to collect or assemble files into a specific directory structure. If multiple copies of the files are not needed (or need to be avoided) moving a directory within the same file system is faster and uses less disk space than copying and removing the original.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nThe source code for the [`Move`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/move-task?view=vs-2022) task mentions that [moving a directory could be supported](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7d65cb31cdbb92774e28adc44e73f03fdb103e62/src/Tasks/Move.cs#LL20C1-L24C19). The `Move` task could be extended to support moving directories.\r\n\r\nExtending `Move` to support directories might follow a pattern similar to proposed changes to the [`Copy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/copy-task?view=vs-2022) task (see ##5881).\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\nAn alternate approach could be to add a new `MoveDir` task. There are [`MakeDir`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/makedir-task?view=vs-2022) and [`RemoveDir`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/removedir-task?view=vs-2022) tasks that are specific to directories.\r\n\r\nA `MoveDir` task may have required parameters for `SourceDirectories` and `DestinationDirectories` that are expected to be one-to-one.",
