  "body": "When you cancel command-line MSBuild, we send the cancellation signal through the API and also writes status to stdout. But it does so directly:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/39e20dce0c00a572f1fbd20a0a520d4e941bbc33/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L1007\r\n\r\nAnd terminallogger tends to immediately overwrite that message with status updates, so it's not obvious whether cancellation is in progress.",
