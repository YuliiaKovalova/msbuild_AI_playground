  "body": "We all know solution (.sln) files are not ideal:\r\n- Hard to read\r\n- Hard to version control\r\n- Are overly verbose\r\n- Use a non-standard format\r\n\r\nAn SDK-style solution file would provide the following benefits:\r\n- Easier to read, and would consistent with other metadata .NET files e.g. csproj, Directory.build.props etc\r\n- Easier to version control, as XML is\r\n- Removing heavy use of Guids would reduce it's size\r\n- Would be more approachable for new-comers.\r\n\r\nThere have been community attempts at this, most notably https://github.com/JeffCyr/MSBuild.SolutionSdk.\r\n\r\nThere has also been much talk about this on Tech Twitter in recent years:\r\n- https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/status/1176924151250071553\r\n\r\n.NET 7 seems like a great time for this!",
