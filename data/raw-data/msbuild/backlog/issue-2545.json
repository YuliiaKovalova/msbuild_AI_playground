  "title": "Large contention in MSBuildNameIgnoreCaseComparer",
  "body": "MSBuildNameIgnoreCaseComparer exists to let the expander lookup \"property names\" keys without substring. It does so, however, in a manner that in my mind not ideal: it lets certain classes \"setup\" the offsets that it should be using to compare by muting fields on the static instance, which means that it needs to lock access to the class to avoid multiple threads partying on the same state. The act of calling Monitor.Enter is [showing up on the radar](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2429), I do wonder if we a multi-proc build we'll see lots of contention here.\r\n\r\nI think a better approach would to pass all that information down to RetrievableEntryHashSet and have it do the right comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
