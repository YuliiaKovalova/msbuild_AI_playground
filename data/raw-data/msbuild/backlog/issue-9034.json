  "title": "[Bug]: Disable echoing input to terminal when Terminal Logger is enabled",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nOn certain platforms key presses are by default echo'ed to the terminal even when a program is running. I don't believe this is desirable with /tl as it can break the output in a random way.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nBuild with /tl on Linux. Hit keys when the build is running.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExcept for special commands like Ctrl+C, key presses do nothing.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nKey presses are echoed to console, breaking and interleaving the output. For example when hitting Enter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/12206368/e429a6be-4793-4655-ad67-650062476d55)\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nReproduces in current main (commit hash 4598629a2493ed6b366ab00d595ecd53a3164b60).",
