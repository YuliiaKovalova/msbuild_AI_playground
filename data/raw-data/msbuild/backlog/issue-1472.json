  "body": "Related to #1442. Moved from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues/932.\r\n@onotovy said:\r\n> When I have a CSproj open for editing, if I comment-out a property group, when I hit save, it moves the commented area to the top of the file, right under project. That's startling and wrong as it moves items from where I want. Further, if it can change the meaning if they're uncommented and not restored to the correct location (which someone may not know where it belongs).\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm accessing the XML by going through the RawXml property: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/blob/dev15-rc2/src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Managed.VS/ProjectSystem/VS/Utilities/IMsBuildAccessor.cs#L53.\r\n\r\nFYI @AndyGerlicher @rainersigwald ",
