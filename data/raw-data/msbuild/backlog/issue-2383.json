  "body": "Hi team,\r\n\r\nI have a .NET solution that I built on a build system with MSBuild 14, VS 2015 installed and  Windows 10.  I'm now trying to find the minimal setup for building that project. I have Windows Server 2016 OS. I prefer all the build tools to be standalone if possible. I'm currently able to build the project with MSBuild and VS2015/VS2017 installed but I'm unable to build without VS installed. Is it possible? Is there a standalone edition of the latest MSBuild?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nNedko",
