  "title": "[Feature Request]: BuildCheck diagnostics look different than 'normal' build diagnostics",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nBuildCheck diagnostics don't have the kind of structured formatting that project-specific diagnostics have, so they look out of place and jarring:\r\n\r\n```terminal\r\n> dotnet build /analyze\r\nMSBUILD : warning : C:\\Users\\chethusk\\Code\\Scratch\\msbuild-analyzer-examples\\double-writes\\double-writes.csproj (12,5): BC0102: Tasks Copy and Copy from projects double-writes.csproj and double-writes.csproj write the same file: C:\\Users\\chethusk\\Code\\Scratch\\msbuild-analyzer-examples\\double-writes\\obj\\storage\\Class1.cs.\r\n  double-writes succeeded with 1 warning(s) (0.4s) \u2192 bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\double-writes.dll\r\n    C:\\Users\\chethusk\\Code\\Scratch\\msbuild-analyzer-examples\\double-writes\\double-writes.csproj(16,5): warning XTRA0123: Nuh uh!\r\n\r\nBuild succeeded with 2 warning(s) in 0.9s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error duplicates the project file path, and it has an unnecessary `MSBUILD` prefix compared to the XTRA0123 warning I created.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nWe should attempt as much as possible to have uniform rendering of diagnostics - even if the 'groupings' of the diagnostics are different (whole-build vs per-project).\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nAnalyzer diagnostics should as much as possible have the same formatting as existing per-project diagnostics.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
