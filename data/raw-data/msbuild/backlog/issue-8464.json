There are tens of thousands of live tasks after a simple build is finished because the loop is creating them faster than they can be processed.\r\n\r\nWe should instead wait (as in _blocked_) until a log event sets `ShouldRerender` to true. If we're also interested in waiting for a key press, then unless console has a proper async API, `Console.ReadKey` should be offloaded to its thread.",
