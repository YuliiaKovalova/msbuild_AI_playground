If you just want some cross-platform bits to try out, there are instructions at https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild#unofficial-getting-net-core-msbuild-binaries-without-building-the-code\n\nThis is all vastly more complicated than it should be and we're working toward fixing it. It'd help to know what you hoped for when you started looking.\n",
