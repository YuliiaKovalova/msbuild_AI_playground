  "body": "This bug report refers specifically to MSBuild running on Windows.\n\nIf I start MSBuild.exe with process priority \"below normal\" (6) and the /m command line switch, and that MSBuild.exe starts child MSBuild.exe processes, then these child nodes still run with normal (8) process priority. It would be better for them to inherit the parent process' priority, because without such inheritance, it becomes impossible to effectively \"nice\" a multiprocessor build.\n\nThanks,\nPhilip\nVisual Studio Team Services\n",
