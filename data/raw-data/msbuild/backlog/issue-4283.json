  "body": "@davkean, @BenVillalobos and I were doing some exploratory PerfView analysis and noticed this.\r\n\r\n#3969 tried to reduce the allocation of `Regex.Match` objects that aren't necessary because all we care about is `IsMatch`. That simplified the code greatly. But unfortunately, it still allocates a `Match` object under the covers.\r\n\r\nWe should replace usages of `FileUtilitiesRegex.DrivePattern`, `FileUtilitiesRegex.UncPattern`, `StartWithDrivePattern`, and `StartsWithUncPattern` with functions that do the match explicitly without allocation. The patterns are pretty straightforward, so the matcher methods should still be pretty readable.",
