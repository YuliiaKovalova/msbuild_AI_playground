  "body": "# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2025-26646: .NET Spoofing Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.xxx and .NET 8.0.xxx SDK. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\n\nA vulnerability exists in .NET SDK or MSBuild applications where external control of file name or path allows an unauthorized attacked to perform spoofing over a network.\n\n## Announcement\n\nAnnouncement for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/356\n\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\n\nProjects which do not utilize the [DownloadFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/downloadfile-task)  build task are not susceptible to this vulnerability.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\n\n* Any installation of .NET 9.0.105 SDK, .NET 9.0.203 SDK or earlier.\n* Any installation of .NET 8.0.115 SDK, .NET 8.0.311 or .NET 8.0.312 SDK, .NET 8.0.408 or .NET 8.0.309 SDK or earlier.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected Packages\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected packages versions listed below\n\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core) |>= 15.8.166, <=15.9.20<br />>=16.0.461, <= 16.11.0<br />>= 17.0.0, <= 17.8.3<br/>>= 17.9.5, <= 17.10.4<br />17.11.4<br />17.12.6 <br />17.13.9 | 15.9.30<br />16.11.6<br />17.8.29<br/>17.10.29<br />17.12.36<br />17.13.26 <br />17.14.8\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a .NET SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 SDK or .NET 8.0 SDK. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install the appropriate SDK: `.NET 9.0.300` for Visual Studio 2022 v17.14, `.NET 9.0.204` for v17.13, or `.NET 9.0.106` for v17.12.

The SDK with 17.14.5 is patched though. A future SDK will bring this into alignment.",
