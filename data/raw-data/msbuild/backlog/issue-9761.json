You\u2019ll need the machine name and in [Rerun OptProf on a Lab Machine (wiki)](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_wiki/wikis/DevDiv.wiki/2671/Rerun-OptProf-on-a-Lab-Machine?anchor=walkthrough) shows where to get the machine name and how to re-run test.\r\n* Start the ETW collecting prior the repro run:\r\n```\r\nperfview collect /NoGui /Providers=*Microsoft-Build /BufferSize:8096 /CircularMB:8096 /NoNGenRundown /DataFile:<path-to-trace-file-that-will-be-created>\r\n```\r\n* If the issue reproduces (VS hangs in project unloading for several minutes), create 2 or 3 memory dumps (minidump should suffice) couple dozens of seconds appart. For dump creation, you can use e.g. ProcessExplorrer:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/3809076/7db020fe-9ef4-4b0c-9c7d-9dee9242c2d1)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notes** \r\n* It's not clear if the issue is only by timing or by env as well - but it's probably best idea to try to repro on machines that experienced the issue during the initial run. \r\n* It might not be easy to reproduce - so possibly having more machines from the CI pool to run the repro might help to get it quicker.\r\n* The machines are kept only for certain duration (I believe 48 or 72 hours) - and then it gets force recycled\r\n* Copy out the collected data to some internal share or alternatively sharepoint",
