  "body": "### Context\n\nVS hangs during solution close - turins out to be caused by hang in `BuildManager.EndBuild`\nThere are almost 3k cases hit in wild on 17.11\n\n### Analysis\n\nCab: https://watsonportal.microsoft.com/CabAnalysis?CabIdentifier=https://eaus2watcab01.blob.core.windows.net/global-202409/f1d6f9d9-57c1-47af-91c9-1973b6d19519.zip\nPart of: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/2254960\n\nVS hanging due to `BuildManager.EndBuild` stuck waiting on the `_noActiveSubmissionsEvent` or `_noNodesActiveEvent` (not possible to distinguish due to release build optimizations).\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f2441a0-26e2-45b2-9f80-4e607835f893)\n\nBased on stacks the `CancelAllSubmissionsAsync`  was called.\nAt the same time the InProcNode is still running:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f47077dc-a199-4dfb-9835-3e97bc65caa8)\n\nThough based on the code it seems like we do not want to kill InProcNode in VS:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/ab7c28995f198f717aa5fb823e6fc36cadf42254/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildParameters.cs#L596-L604\n\nHowever it would mean that the node count (`_activeNodes.Count`) wouldn't reach zero and we wouldn't be able to signal the `_noNodesActiveEvent`:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/ab7c28995f198f717aa5fb823e6fc36cadf42254/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs#L2558-L2587\n\n\nThis feels unlikely - as it would hang always when we'd have InProcNode in VS.\n\n\n### Next steps in investigation\n\nDebug through solution close in VS and find out if `CheckForActiveNodesAndCleanUpSubmissions` ever signals\n",
