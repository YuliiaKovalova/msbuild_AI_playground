The verbosity is not a problem anymore, however, some of the messages should be printed immediately and TL dos does not do that yet: like in the case when a test hangs xunit has a feature where that prints \"[Long Running Test]\u201d and we need to show this message asap. We will need to figure out a solution for that before we may turn it on.",

        "body": "Discussed internally. \r\nResolution: \r\n- We delay turning TL in runtime issue due to the problem mentioned above. The culprit is that those immediate messages are logged from `Exec` task and runtime team does not have control over it and its messages in particular. It makes the problem difficult to work-around and the progress messages API that solves it for custom tasks would not help much here unless we add some support to `Exec` task.  \r\n- We shall include the runtime scenario (that is calling scripts from exec tasks) when working on progress messages API. Created #10416. We will reconsider turning the TL on in runtime repo when the exec task enhancement is handled. \r\n- We do not consider this problem a blocker for the new Terminal Logger.",
