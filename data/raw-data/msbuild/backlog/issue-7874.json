When exactly same project is compiled over command line msbuild analyzers are executed correctly and warnings\\errors are reported.\r\n\r\nAttaching bin logs from project compilation from command line and from code over BuildManager for comparison. Also code which is compiling projects is attached.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nRoslyn analyzers are executed during compilation.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nRoslyn analyzers are not executed and build will not show any warnings\\errors.\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\nWhy there is difference in compilation on command line vs BuildManager.\r\n[SolutionBuilder.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/9304549/SolutionBuilder.zip)\r\n ",

        "body": "> I'm not familiar with `BuildManager.DefaultBuildManager.Build` or what the implications of it are.\r\n\r\nIt's an MSBuild concept happening above the Roslyn compiler layer. All builds run through a `BuildManager.Build` call (with varying indirection) and `DefaultBuildManager` is the default. Roslyn is not at fault here.\r\n\r\n@payn-git There are a few problems with your approach:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n            var buildRequest = new BuildRequestData(projectPath, myGlobalProperties, null, new[] { \"Restore\", \"ReBuild\" }, null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of evaluating the project from _before restore_ is being cached and reused when running `Rebuild`. That state may miss information about analyzers (or references or other things). You must run the `Restore` and `Rebuild` operations separately, so that the second evaluation can pull in updated information from the restore.  I see that you were doing this in the \"command line\" approach as well, which is broken too. There you should specify `-restore -t:Rebuild` instead of `-t:Restore;Rebuild`.\r\n\r\nMore critically to your immediate problem is this from the log:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nNoImport: $(NuGetTargets) at (16;3) false condition; (Exists('$(NuGetTargets)') and '$(SkipImportNuGetBuildTargets)' != 'true' was evaluated as Exists('C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\NuGet\\17.0\\Microsoft.NuGet.targets') and '' != 'true').\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's an inconsistency between `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019` and the later `17.0`, which appears to be coming in through an environment variable. You may wish to clear that if it's critical to be able to run your builds in a VS 2019 context from a VS 2022 developer command prompt.",
