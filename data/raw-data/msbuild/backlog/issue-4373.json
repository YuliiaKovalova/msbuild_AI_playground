  "body": "I know that binding redirects for web projects are output as warnings and the user can double click on them to add a binding explicitly but I was wondering why auto generating binding redirects for web projects is not possible? I saw this [comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Tasks/AssemblyDependency/ResolveAssemblyReference.cs#L1035) as well but I have not found the limiting factor that prevents it?",

        "body": "The story I've heard is twofold:\r\n\r\n1. The binding redirects for web projects don't live in `app.config` but in an IIS configuration file.\r\n2. That configuration file is generally _checked into the project_, and is used in F5 debug builds from its checked-in location.\r\n\r\nItem 1 is obviously something that could be changed. Item 2 gets into more philosophy: generally, people are resistant to change user source code as part of the build, because it's too easy to change things accidentally and then get them checked in forever.",

        "body": "I am using the GenerateBindingRedirects task to update our web.config files and I was wondering if there was something I was missing about this. It seems to be working for our needs so I was curious if I was missing a reason this wasn't done more generically. I will say that point 2 has been quite accurate. One more thing I ran into was that many of our developers have different MVC libraries installed on their machines based on when they started and that causes quite a bit of meaningless churn in the bindings section.\r\n\r\nI am actually looking into pulling the runtime section out into its own configuration file that will not be checked into version control for that reason. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing some other limitation that would make this impossible. Thank you.",
