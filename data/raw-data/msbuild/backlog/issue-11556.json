  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhen building a class library project with multiple Target Frameworks specified in the TargetFrameworks property, the dotnet msbuild command builds all specified frameworks on Windows but only the first framework on Linux.\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n\n1. Create a class library project targeting netstandard2.1 and net8.0.\n2. Modify the project file (CombinedLibrary.csproj) to include the following content:\n\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFrameworks>net8.0;netstandard2.1</TargetFrameworks>\n    <LangVersion>10.0</LangVersion>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n</Project>\n\n```\n3. Run the following command to build the project:\n`dotnet msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=AnyCPU /v:m CombinedLibrary.csproj`\n\n4. On Windows build output is:\n\n>   CombinedLibrary net8.0 succeeded (0.5s) \u2192 bin\\Release\\net8.0\\CombinedLibrary.dll\n>   CombinedLibrary netstandard2.1 succeeded (0.9s) \u2192 bin\\Release\\netstandard2.1\\CombinedLibrary.dll\n> \n> Build succeeded in 1.9s\n\n5. On Linux build output is:\n\n>   CombinedLibrary succeeded with 1 warning(s) (1.7s) \u2192 bin/Release/net8.0/CombinedLibrary.dll\n>     CSC : warning CS1668: Invalid search path ':/Microsoft.NET/Odbc.Net' specified in 'LIB environment variable' -- 'directory does not exist'\n> \n> Build succeeded with 1 warning(s) in 5.4s\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBoth netstandard2.1 and net8.0 should be built on both Windows and Linux.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn Windows, both netstandard2.1 and net8.0 are built. On Linux, only netstandard8.0 is built.\n\n### Analysis\n\nRunning the same command twice with /p:TargetFramework is a workaround for Linux, but if a project has PostBuildEvent configured, then it runs twice, which is not the case for Windows.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\ndotnet --info output:\n\n- On Linux:\n\n> .NET SDK:\n>  Version:           9.0.100\n>  Commit:            59db016f11\n>  Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n>  MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n> \n> Runtime Environment:\n>  OS Name:     ol\n>  OS Version:  8.4\n>  OS Platform: Linux\n>  RID:         linux-x64\n\n- On Windows:\n\n> .NET SDK:\n>  Version:           9.0.100\n>  Commit:            59db016f11\n>  Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n>  MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n> \n> Runtime Environment:\n>  OS Name:     Windows\n>  OS Version:  10.0.22000\n>  OS Platform: Windows\n>  RID:         win-x64",
