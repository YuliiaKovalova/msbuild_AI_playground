It should be returning !Log.HasLoggedErrors instead of hardcoding true: https://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core/TaskLoggingHelper.cs,e828a76d6ec75c83,references\r\n 2. It only catches FileNotFoundException, and it should be catching all exceptions - I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s another exception that is not getting caught here.\r\n\r\n",
