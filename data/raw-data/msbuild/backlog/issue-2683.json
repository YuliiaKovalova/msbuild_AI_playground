  "body": "I was looking into reference source at [Microsoft Reference Source](//referencesource.microsoft.com) and [Roslyn Source](//source.roslyn.io) to see the props/targets, to understand how they are written, while I was going through [MSBuild docs](//docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/).\r\n\r\nWhen I found these lines, [Microsoft.Common.props(74)](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#MSBuildFiles/C/ProgramFiles(x86)/MSBuild/14.0/Microsoft.Common.props,74) and [Same @ Roslyn Source](http://source.roslyn.io/#MSBuildFiles/C/ProgramFiles(x86)/MSBuild/14.0/Microsoft.Common.props,74)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- If building using 4.X MSBuild, we want to act like this project is TV 4.0, so import\r\n        Microsoft.Common.props from the 4.0 location, and make sure everything else in here is \r\n        set up such that if it's defaulted to something there, it won't be overridden here. -->\r\n<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\4.0\\Microsoft.Common.props\" Condition=\"'$(MSBuildAssemblyVersion)' == '' and Exists('$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\4.0\\Microsoft.Common.props')\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to click the 4.0 props file, It did not redirect, so I changed the URL from this:\r\n`<domain>/#MSBuildFiles/C/ProgramFiles(x86)/MSBuild/`__`14.0`__`/Microsoft.Common.props`\r\nto\r\n`<domain>/#MSBuildFiles/C/ProgramFiles(x86)/MSBuild/`__`4.0`__`/Microsoft.Common.props`\r\n\r\nI also tried 12.0, but no luck. I looked into this repo but it does not have 4.0 props.\r\n\r\nSo, Where can I find the 4.0 `Microsoft.Common.props` file and other props/targets that came with old MSBuild tools?",

After that works, you'll just need to build and index any project that builds using MSBuild 4.0.\r\n\r\nYou can find the actual targets files for MSBuild 4.0 in your Windows directory:\r\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\r\n\r\nAs this is not an MSBuild issue I'm going to close this.",
