  "body": "ParallelConsoleLogger and SerialConsoleLogger both inherit from BaseConsoleLogger.\r\n\r\nIn BaseConsoleLogger, there's this default implementation of OutputProperties:\r\nhttp://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.Build/Logging/BaseConsoleLogger.cs,bab9b832414327cb\r\n\r\nIn ParallelConsoleLogger, it is overridden like this:\r\nhttp://source.dot.net/#Microsoft.Build/Logging/ParallelLogger/ParallelConsoleLogger.cs,d092c8ee77e2800f\r\n\r\nDifference is in this line:\r\n```\r\nWritePretty(String.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, \"{0,-30} = \", prop.Key));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this difference if you use a logger that doesn't use `ENABLEMPLOGGING`, name values will be aligned at 30 char column. For a parallel logger the properties are not aligned:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/679326/22996593/30112bba-f384-11e6-82b3-3b263d19a872.png)\r\n\r\nWe should decide which behavior is better and unify to use that. I think not aligning is better since 30 chars is arbitrary and since mostly everyone uses the Parallel logger we'll preserve this behavior and won't break the majority. Also the non-aligned format is easier to parse.",
