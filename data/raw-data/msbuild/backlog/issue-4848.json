  "body": "We encountered a [Roslyn-originated issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/39471), or that is our goal, but the error we are facing seems more like an `MSBuild` assembly issue.\r\n\r\nBasically, we are encountering this `WorkspaceDiagnostics` error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssembly Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild, Version=2.10.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\r\npackages\\microsoft.codeanalysis.workspaces.msbuild\\2.10.0\\lib\\net46\\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf memory serves, this used to work, no problem. It fails now, regardless whether we have a VS2017 environment, or have a side-by-side VS, i.e. +VS2019, environment, and so on. The open fails.\r\n\r\nI've read some blurbs in scattered blogs to do with something to do with `assemblyBinding`, binding redirects, but nothing definitively pointing to, *that is the workaround, solution, ...*, what have you.\r\n\r\nI posted [a body of work](/mwpowellhtx/Kingdom.Roslyn.Compilation.Services) that more or less \"works\", patch forthcoming which fails when there are Workspace diagnostics.",
