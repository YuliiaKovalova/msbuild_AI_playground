  "title": "adding Retries, RetryDelayMilliseconds parameters to Delete task",
  "body": "Copy task already has such parameters.\nit is good for situations when one asynchronously stops windows service (for example) and one need to make sure that files are not locked anymore\n\nI'm not saying that situation itself is good. However, I like the approach of \"Copy\" task, it allows me to wait for some time and copy files again.\n\nI would like to add such parameters to \"Delete\" task as well.\n\nif nobody minds, I will make pull request\n",
