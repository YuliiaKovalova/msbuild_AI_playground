The full message is in the attached file.\r\n\r\n[Build error.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1144432/Build.error.txt)\r\n\r\nOne of the steps prior to 'Build Solution' is 'Prepare the SonarQube Analysis'\r\nFrom what I can gather it looks like the process is trying to remove something that another node hasn't finished building.\r\n\r\nCurrently to get around the problem we're 'forcing msbuild to use a single worker process, by passing in the param /m:1 to the build step' as per [https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/2275#ref-commit-2f1b593](url).\r\n\r\nWe're using SonarQube Version 6.4 (build 25310) and C# Code Analyzer 6.1 (build 2359), and TFS 2015 Update 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
