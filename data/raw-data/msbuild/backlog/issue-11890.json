  "title": "Teach Copilot setup about our SDK version",
  "body": "Right now, our Copilot setup steps try to install a good version of the .NET SDK with this call to `setup-dotnet`:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/4ad462496537cd497f9c43531acb21f44d58cd67/.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml#L20-L22\n\nHowever, our `global.json` is nonstandard: we don't pin an SDK in \"the usual way\". We use an Arcade-specific `tools.dotnet` element that `setup-dotnet` doesn't know about.\n\nUpdate `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` to\n\n1. extract the value of `tools.dotnet` to get an SDK version to install\n2. pass that to `setup-dotnet`\n\nI think that may involve a script using `jq` and setting a GitHub Actions variable in step 1, then using that variable in step 2, but I'd love to hear about better options.",
