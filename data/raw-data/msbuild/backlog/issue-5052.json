  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have the following repro solution structure (see attachmeent):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSolution\r\n|- ProjectA \"DependentProjectsOutputNotCopied_Dependency\"\r\n   |- Content: Content.txt (Copy if newer)\r\n|- ProjectB \"DependentProjectsOutputNotCopied_Reference\"\r\n   |- ProjectReference: ProjectA\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth projects target .NET Framework 4.7.2, both are using the new SDK-styled project format.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I build ProjectB in such a way that ProjectA is built at the same time (e.g., if ProjectA is not up-to-date or by performing \u201cRebuild all\u201d) the Content.txt is correctly put into the output folder of ProjectB. This should also be the case if ProjectA is not built in this MSBuild run.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIn all cases where ProjectA is not built (e.g., because it is up-to-date), the Content.txt is NOT copied to the output folder of ProjectB. When I \u201cexecute\u201d ProjectB (unit test project) it runs into runtime problems because the necessary Content.txt is not available.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\nMSBuild used by VS 2019 16.4.1\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows 10 1903",
