You can use the debugger to break in to that point and inspect the state manually, or you can preprocess the project and follow the dependency chain manually (don't forget to account for `BeforeTargets`/`AfterTargets` as well as `DependsOnTargets`, and hope you don't have too many dynamically-changed dependency properties).",
