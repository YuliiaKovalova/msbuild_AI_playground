The system cannot find the file specified.\r\nFile name: 'protobuf-net, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=257b51d87d2e4d67'\r\n   at Effects.EffectData..cctor()\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nI created custom .targets file run it through .Net 5 msbuild. It starts app, but when it tries to find protobuf-net.dll, it fails with exception above, but at the same time I can run test with the same class and it will work as expected.\r\nThis effect is present only when run app with custom .targets file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\nHow this issue could be worked around? Its quite important for me, because It is blocking me from running the project\r\n",
