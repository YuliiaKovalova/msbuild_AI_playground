  "title": "[Bug]: Number literals are interpreted differently depending on locale",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nPassing literals with dots and commas to property functions results in differently evaluated projects depending on locale / regional settings under which the MSBuild process runs.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n    <Message Text=\"$([MSBuild]::Add('1,2', 1))\"/>\r\n  </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `Message` task should print `13` regardless of locale.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nEnglish/invariant: `13`\r\n\r\nSwitch **Regional format** to one that uses comma for decimal separator, for example French. The task prints `2,2`.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThis is caused by calling the default overloads of `double.Parse` in evaluation.\r\n\r\nDoesn't look like a recent regression but the .NET Framework-bundled MSBuild doesn't seem to have this bug.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild version 17.7.0-preview-23267-02+fe79798bd for .NET Framework",
