  "title": "Old and new csproj format, problems with /target:restore;build",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have on sln with old and new csproj format together. All targeting net461. The old projects are still there are:\r\n\r\n1. Migration project using EF6\r\n2. Tests using Specflow and NUnit\r\n\r\nThis kind of projects do magic on the csproj so we preferred to keep them with the old format till we migrate to efcore and specflow gives support for the new csproj.\r\n\r\nSo with Visual Studio 15.4 everything seems to work fine but with Visual Studio Build Tools, when we issue `&'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe' /p:Configuration=Release \"/t:Restore;Build\"` we get the following problems:\r\n\r\n1. Test project: `This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer. [...] The missing file is ..\\..\\packages\\NUnit3TestAdapter.3.8.0\\build\\net35\\NUnit3TestAdapter.props.`\r\n2. EF project: `warning MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly \"EntityFramework.Sq\r\nlServer, Version=6.0.0.0 [...] Considered ..\\..\\packages\\EntityFramework.6.1.3\\lib\\net45\\EntityFramework.SqlServer.dll`\r\n\r\nI guess it's because the restore issued here with msbuild puts everything on `%UserProfile%\\.nuget` the thing is that with the normal nuget.exe issuing a restore, when it detects an old csproj it also puts dependencies on the packages folder of the solution, so it seems theres a mismatch on behavior, ultimately causing the build to fail... Is it the expected behavior or this is an unsupported scenario?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

At least in the workflows you can install it mentions .NET Core 1.0 - 1.1, does that implicate being able to compile netcoreapp2.0 or it's scheduled for a future release?",
