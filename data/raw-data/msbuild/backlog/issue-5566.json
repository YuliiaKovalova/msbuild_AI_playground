        "body": "First pass investigation notes:\r\n\r\nIt looks like, by design, MSBuild clears out files created in a prior build that weren't created in the current build after a build completes.\r\n\r\nHere's the order of operations:\r\n**Successful run**\r\n1. Build test project\r\n2. test references parent, so build parent.\r\n3. parent explicitly copies the nupkg into its output dir\r\n4. test copies parents contents into its output dir\r\n5. Incremental clean runs\r\n\t1. Grab all files created last build (none)\r\n\t2. Compare to this build.\r\n\t3. Delete any that were created before but not this time\r\n6. Your nupkg is fine.\r\n\r\n**Your scenario**\r\n1. Build test project\r\n2. test references parent BUT parent built successfully last run\r\n3. no parent build\r\n4. test does not copy parent build outputs\r\n5. Incremental clean runs\r\n\t1. Grab all files created last build (parent's generated projects INCLUDING nupkg)\r\n\t2. Compare to this build (which didn't grab the nupkg because the parent didn't build)\r\n\t3. Delete the diff\r\n6. nupkg is deleted.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there is any existing infrastructure to _always_ copy certain outputs from transitive references. I'll ask the team.\r\n\r\nAs a very imperfect & temporary solution you can create a target similar to the one that exists in your parent project that always copies over the nupkg.",
