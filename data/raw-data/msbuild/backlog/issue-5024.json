  "body": "I am currently considering learning C# due to some intriguing features, but it is very important to me to use only FOSS software as much as possible. As such, if C# isn't (yet) fully FOSS I will stick with fully FOSS systems, such as C++ on a FOSS toolchain. Many C# developers have told me that C# is now fully FOSS, but when I run the compilation script of [a FOSS C# project](https://github.com/ModdedMinecraftClub/mmcc-member-bot) on Debian Linux using the .NET SDK from the official aptitude repositories, I get the following concerning message:\r\n\r\n> Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.4.0+e901037fe for .NET Core\r\n> Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nI asked about this on the C# Discord and someone told me that this is the correct GitHub project to ask about this on. Is C# fully FOSS (yet), or are there still proprietary components? In any case, it would be better to clarify next to this message, even if just to a link that fully explains the situation. \r\n\r\nVersion:\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet --version\r\n3.1.100\r\n```\r\n",

A good page that completely explains every the general purpose and usage in practice of every tool, document (e.g. specification), etc. and what license it is under would be very useful to allow me to determine if C# is worth learning.

Is there some alternative (perhaps 3rd party) Linux repository set (for a variety of distributions) with FOSS binaries?
