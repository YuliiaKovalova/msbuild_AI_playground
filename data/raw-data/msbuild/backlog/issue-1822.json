  "body": "The download link for \"Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017\" on https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017 isn't a real link, its some weird `blob` link: `blob:https://www.visualstudio.com/d0c0b53b-9358-449e-ac2e-f4dd0782f590`. This makes it hard to download from an automated script.\r\n\r\n(I would have used the chocolatey package, but that only has 2015 in it).\r\n\r\nCan you please look into it?",
