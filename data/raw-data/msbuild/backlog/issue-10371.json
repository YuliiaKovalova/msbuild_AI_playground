  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of ConfigurationProvider and initiating instances of [BuildAnalyzerConfiguration](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BuildCheck/API/BuildAnalyzerConfiguration.cs) could result exception and build error in case the configuration was provided incorrectly:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BuildCheck/API/BuildAnalyzerConfiguration.cs#L95-L100 \r\n```C#\r\n    private static void ThrowIncorrectValueException(string key, string value)\r\n    {\r\n        // TODO: It will be nice to have the filename where the incorrect configuration was placed. \r\n        throw new BuildCheckConfigurationException(\r\n                $\"Incorrect value provided in config for key {key}: '{value}'\",\r\n                buildCheckConfigurationErrorScope: BuildCheckConfigurationErrorScope.EditorConfigParser);\r\n```\r\nThe exception shows only incorrect value, however there is no information on which file was used for this specific value.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nIn case there are multiple upper directories with editorconfig containing incorrect values it not clear from which exactly was incorrect value was used and resulted build to fail\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nInclude the full path of `.editorconfig` from where the incorrect value was parsed.\r\nThe change will require updating the current parsing logic and have additional information per the option with the file information from where it was fetched (increases the usage of memory)\r\n",
