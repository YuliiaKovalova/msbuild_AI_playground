But of course we don't expect you to know that! Thanks for letting us know.\r\n\r\nI filed an internal bug about this with the setup team, but it's hard for you to track that externally. I think the best thing for you to do is file a new feedback issue at https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com. If you link it in this issue, I'll associate it with the bug I just filed and you should be able to get updates as they happen.",
