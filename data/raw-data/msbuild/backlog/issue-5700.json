The process cannot access the file 'C:\\Users\\VssAdministrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.NETFramework,Version=v4.8.SqlClrAttributes.vb' because it is being used by another process.\r\n\r\nThis happens on the hosted agents of azure devops. See analysis for more info\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nBuild multiple sql projects in parallel, you'll get this error once on a while\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nNo error\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe issue seems really close to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/1479 , I've previously reported a similar issue in https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/991965/errors-in-hosted-agent-pipeline-the-process-cannot.html This issue was closed and they pointed here, and it was fixed, but probably not for sqlproj projects.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nLatest hosted agents of azure devops",
