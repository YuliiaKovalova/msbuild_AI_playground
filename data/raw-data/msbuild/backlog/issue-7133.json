If you're still seeing unexpectedly slow builds on ARM Macs, please share logs or a repro case that builds faster than on Intel.\r\n\r\n@evenlee, on the other hand, is seeing slower builds _within Visual Studio for Mac_ when building a .NET Framework 4.5 project that does not use the new .NET SDK. That is a different codepath in Visual Studio for Mac, and we think that issue would best be investigated by the VSMac team. Please file a bug with them at https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mac/report-a-problem, ideally with a repro case and logs showing the build time differences. You may also be able to get better behavior by converting your project to use the .NET SDK, which can target .NET Framework 4.5.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this bug since we haven't been able to reproduce the originally reported performance issue and the other issue needs investigation by the VSMac folks.",
