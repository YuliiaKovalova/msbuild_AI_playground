  "title": "Ability to log events from project evaluation",
  "body": "Need to\r\n- get evaluation events per Project / ProjectInstance object\r\n- know when evaluation starts and finishes\r\n\r\nImplementation possibilities:\r\n- add overloads to Project evaluation to pass in additional loggers. The ones inherited from the `ProjectCollection` are not good because those are shared across all projects built within that collection. Also, the events themselves do not link back to the project object under evaluation / build.\r\n- add 2 new evaluation events, `BeginEvaluation` and `EndEvaluation`. Custom logger implementations can then trigger events, etc\r\n\r\nChanges request by CPS.",

        "body": "Ooh, this is great. The problem I'm running into is a lot of messages stemming from evaluation logged with the default BuildEventContext, and so it's impossible to attribute the message to evaluation of a particular project. So the structured log has a lot of messages at the root level.\r\n\r\nIdeally for all messages logged during evaluation we should know 1) it's evaluation and 2) which project is being evaluated.",
