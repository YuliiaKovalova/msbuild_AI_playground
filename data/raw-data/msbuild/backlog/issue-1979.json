  "body": "Maybe everything is working as it should, however I am finding that if  I change a single csharp file in my main project, msbuild when I press f5 in visual studio or `dotnet build` it seems to go through building every single project in the solution, surely it should be checking that no source file was changed and skipping past them very quickly, In large projects with 30-40 projects, this gets very slow to build.",

        "body": "Is the compiler actually running for every project, or do you just see that every project has MSBuild run on it?\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio, there are two layers of up-to-date checks. MSBuild itself has a check per-target (assuming the target specifies `Inputs` and `Outputs`), which can't be disabled, and which also runs on the command line. However, the logged output of a build that is up-to-date can look very similar to a build that wasn't (the idea being that incrementality is an optimization and you shouldn't really care, so low-verbosity logging doesn't need to say anything).\r\n\r\nInside Visual Studio, there are \"fast up-to-date checks\" that avoid invoking MSBuild at all when nothing has been modified. However, for new-style SDK projects that use the [new project system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system), that hasn't yet been implemented. That's tracked by https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/62.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this bug assuming that you're seeing the lack of a fast-up-to-date check in VS. If you look at a `/verbosity:diagnostic` log of a build that you think should be incremental and see that work is happening, there may be an incrementality bug in either the SDK targets or your projects. If that's what you're seeing, please follow up with details and we can reopen this issue to investigate.",
