  "body": "This is a new feature in VS: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/filtered-solutions?view=vs-2019. MSBuild doesn't understand `.slnf` files so you can't build them at the command line, but I assume (without looking into it at all) that it would be possible to build a solution metaproject using a `.slnf` and its `.sln` and build it.",
