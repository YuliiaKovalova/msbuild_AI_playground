  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nHaving created some framework depended .net core projects and built them in both VS and MSbuild I get different DEPS.JSON files. VS produces deps file that contains relative file paths while msbuild appears to produce full paths. for example a VS entry looks like this\r\n\r\n\"runtime.debian.8-x64.runtime.native.System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl/4.3.0\": {\r\n        \"runtimeTargets\": {\r\n          **\"runtime/debian.8-x64/native/_._\": {**\r\n            \"rid\": \"debian.8-x64\",\r\n            \"assetType\": \"native\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n },\r\n\r\nWhile the MSbuild entry look like this\r\n\r\n\"runtime.debian.8-x64.runtime.native.System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl/4.3.0\": {\r\n        \"runtimeTargets\": {\r\n          **\"runtimes/debian.8-x64/native/System.Security.Cryptography.Native.OpenSsl.so\": {**\r\n            \"rid\": \"debian.8-x64\",\r\n            \"assetType\": \"native\",\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I use the MSbuild version of the JSON files the application fails to find assemblies when run on non windows platforms. \r\nIF I simply replace the MSbuild (DEPS.JSON) files with their VS counterparts the applications run on LINUX and MAC environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I get MSBuild to produce identical JSON file to VS?\r\n\r\nI am using VS and MSBuild version 15.8.1. This did occur with 15.7.6 as well.",
