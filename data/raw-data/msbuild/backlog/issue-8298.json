        "body": "What you are essentially asking for is a 'post solution build event', an event for after all projects in the solution have been built. There is no such event.\r\n\r\nA solution file (.sln) contains a set of projects. MSBuild reads the solution and creates a 'meta project' that has a `Build` target that will build the set of projects. The build order is not available to the individual projects.\r\n\r\n(Note that you can see the generated meta project by setting an environment variable named `MSBUILDEMITSOLUTION` to the value `1`, e.g. `set MSBUILDEMITSOLUTION=1`. MSBuild will create a _\\<SolutionName\\>.sln.metaproj_ file.) \r\n\r\nThere is a mechanism for customizing the solution (see \"[Customize the solution build](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022#customize-the-solution-build)\") but it is not supported by Visual Studio. It's command line only.\r\n\r\nSince the solution customization is not supported by Visual Studio, we need to resort to something less straight forward.\r\n\r\nIn the solution file you can set 'Project Dependencies' which affect the build order. You can create a simple MSBuild file, add that file to the solution as a project, and set the Project Dependencies so that this project depends on every other project in the solution and therefore must be built last. (When a new project is added to the solution, the Project Dependencies will need to be updated to maintain this special project as the last project to be built.)\r\n\r\nThe following example MSBuild file may be useful as a starting point. A solution expects projects to have `Build`, `Rebuild`, and `Clean` targets, so those targets are provided.\r\n\r\nIn the `Build` target in the [`Exec` task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/exec-task?view=vs-2022), change the value of the `Command` attribute. Replace `echo hello` with your command. Alternatively, remove the `Exec` task and code the work in MSBuild.\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\r\n\r\n  <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n    <Exec Command=\"echo hello\" />\r\n  </Target>\r\n\r\n  <Target Name=\"Rebuild\" DependsOnTargets=\"Clean;Build\" />\r\n\r\n  <Target Name=\"Clean\" />\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```",
