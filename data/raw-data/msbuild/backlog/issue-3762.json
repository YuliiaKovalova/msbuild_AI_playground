  "title": "Fast up-to-date check fails when any dependency has it disabled and has CopyLocal references",
  "body": "When a project A includes `CopyLocal` references, and has `DisableFastUpToDateCheck` set to true, every build will always touch the `CopyUpToDateMarker`.\r\n\r\nThis in turn ensures that no project B depending on this project A is ever considered as being up-to-date (because a project is considered out of date if the `CopyUpToDateMarker` of any of its dependency is more recent than the last build time). This behaviour is observed even though the `CopyLocal` references of project A remain unchanged across builds.\r\n\r\nI would instead expect that even though project A has disabled the fast check, its build should be a no-op when it's up-to-date, and projects depending on it should still be considered up-to-date in that case.\r\n\r\nTo fix this locally, I have overriden `_CopyFilesMarkedCopyLocal` target to define its `Inputs` and `Outputs`. When this is done, the target doesn't run when the `CopyLocal` references are unchanged, the `CopyUpToDateMarker` remains untouched, and my projects depending on project A remain up-to-date.\r\n\r\nAs I'm not super familiar with the codebase I'm not sure that the right solution is to boldly define these in `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets`. However I wonder what would be the best way to improve the behaviour I'm describing?\r\n\r\nMany thanks",
