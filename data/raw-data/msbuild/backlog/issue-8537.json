  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIn my application I host the MSBuild OM and occasionally have to reload from disk. I also save to disk.\r\n\r\nI found that `ProjectRootElement.Reload()` sets the `ProjectRootElement.HasUnsavedChanges` property to true as a side effect of the way the xml tree is rebuilt within the PRE object.\r\nThis has the unfortunate effect of making my project try to save the xml, even though it hasn't really changed since being read from disk.\r\nAnd since the reload was for a PRE at a protected location, the PRE.Save method throws. All for a PRE that had never changed.\r\n\r\nCan you please clear the `HasUnsavedChanges` property at the end of a `Reload`?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nDescribed above.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nReset the `HasUnsavedChanges` property to `false` at the end of a `Reload`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n`HasUnsavedChanges` is `true` after `Reload`\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
