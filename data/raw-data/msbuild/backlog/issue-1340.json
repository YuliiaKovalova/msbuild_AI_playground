  "body": "As the title says, when I save a project from VS, the line endings of block comments go from `\\r\\n` to `\\n`. A simple example:\r\n\r\n1. Create a blank .NET Core project (doesn\u2019t matter what type, I used a console app).\r\n2. In a separate editor, with the project open, create a block comment. Observe that the line endings are \\r\\n.\r\n3. Switch back to VS, left-click on the project node, and hit CTRL+S.\r\n4. Switch back to the project file in an external editor. Line endings are now \\n for the block comment.\r\n\r\nThis creates a bad experience in VS, as VS will helpfully pop up a line ending normalization dialog when the project file is opened directly. I've only tested this is .NET Core apps, but I suspect that it'll hold true for others as well. Moved from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues/742.",
