  "body": "There's an internal bug caused by a RAR output that is\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\MSEnv\\\\PublicAssemblies\\EnvDTE.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\n(note the `\\\\` there). That's a mostly-valid path but if compared as a string it won't be equivalent to the canonicalized version, which causes some downstream problem. RAR should consider using `FileUtilities.NormalizePath()` on its outputs (or maybe all of its input directories?).",

I was too lazy to file anything but perhaps we should.\r\n\r\nI noticed that NuGet restore restores some projects twice if a project is listed twice, once with `\\\\`. If you accidentally have a `\\\\` in a ProjectReference, then it won't get deduplicated and NuGet will build the target twice in the same project.",
