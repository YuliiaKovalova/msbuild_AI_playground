  "body": "I facing a problem while adding the reference for another project. It gives me an error for adding the NuGet file not found in another project. To be clear I have project A (.netcore project) and I want to use project B(.net standard) as a reference. In project A I used **NuspecFile in csproj** file and **GeneratePackageOnBuild = False**. I used this Nuspec file for packaging some .netcore c++ dll. When I used **msbuild /t:pack  projectA.csproj /p:Nuspecfile=Nuget/ProjectA.nuspec** command I was getting an error for nuspec file not found in projectB. I added the nuspec file in Project B and I had to build Project B separately. If I remove the  /p:Nuspecfile=Nuget/ProjectA.nuspec from msbuild /t:pack command. There is no issue. \r\n\r\nMy question is should I have add  **/p:Nuspecfile=Nuget/ProjectA.nuspec** with msbuild /t:pack?\r\nI already added the NuspecFile in the projectA.csproj file. Do we need to add NuspecFile in csproj and msbuild both or only one place?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the problem If I don't use Nuspec file information in both( csproj and msbuild)? \r\nWhat is the right approach?\r\n\r\nAs per Microsft guidelines, I used this command. \r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/msbuild-targets#packing-using-a-nuspec-file\r\n**Packing using a .nuspec file**\r\n\r\n",
