  "body": "Reported by Aleks Gershaft (Microsoft):\r\n\r\nThe problem we hit is that AutoGenerateBindingRedirects is not preserving whitespace when doing transformation on app.config. This means that any config entries that have spaces get XML-encoded to contain special symbols.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the TransformXml target from Web.Publishing.Tasks is able to preserve XML while still transforming it. Would it be possible to make AutoGenerate to also preserve setting formatting?",
