If you\u2019d like to help us learn through this process, we\u2019d be happy for the help, but we can\u2019t promise much right now.\r\n\r\nI put some comments on how to use the EventSources I recently added in https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/specs/event-source.md\r\nThat should help with getting the tracing to work from the command line; since MSBuild is mostly used from Visual Studio, we\u2019re more interested in how it performs there, but we haven\u2019t nailed down how to do that yet. Any help would be greatly appreciated, but if this sounds like too little bang for your buck, we understand.\r\n\r\nHave a great day!",
