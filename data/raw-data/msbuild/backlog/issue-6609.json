  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWe first noticed this through Maestro bumps:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/6029\r\n* https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/6034\r\n\r\nWe have a unit test that is asserting several MSBuild properties are in the diagnostic MSBuild log:\r\n\r\n[build.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/6697116/build.zip)\r\n\r\nIt's looking for text like `AndroidSdkBuildToolsVersion = `. I see this as parameters to tasks, but that's it.\r\n\r\nThat's when I noticed I'm seeing env vars in this log but not properties? Did we regress on that? Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI think, just build a project with `/flp1:LogFile=build.log;Verbosity=diag` and look for properties in the file?\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nProperties are in diagnostic build logs.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI don't see properties in diagnostic build logs?\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0.100-preview.6.21321.13\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n\r\nI don't really see properties in here either:\r\n\r\n[msbuild.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/6697156/msbuild.zip)\r\n",
