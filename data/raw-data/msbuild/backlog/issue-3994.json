  "body": "I just noticed issues in the past few days.  My VS 2017 Pro locks constantly.  If I change the solution build config it locks. If I change a project assembly version it locks.  If I build it locks.  \r\n\r\nWhen it locks up task manager is showing MSBuild.exe (sometimes 2-3 instances under this VS 2017 process instance) running at 25%.  My desktop has 4 cores so that means it is running 1 core at 100%.  Restarts have not changed anything.  It is always the MSbuild.exe that is locking up my visual studio for several minutes.  When those processes complete what they are doing then visual studio becomes usable again.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro\r\nVisual Studio 2017 Pro 15.9.3\r\n\r\nI also noticed now in the Visual Studio Installer it now shows a \"Visual Studio Build Tools 2017 (2)\" item installed (version 15.9.2) as well as the usual \"Visual Studio Professional 2017\" (version 15.9.3).  The build tools must have been added in a recent update?",

Please link the feedback item here and we can investigate further.\r\n\r\nBuild Tools has existed for a long time and an update to VS itself shouldn't have caused it to be installed. If you don't need it, it would be interesting to try uninstalling it, but its presence should not cause hangs.\r\n\r\nAlso, obligatory context questions: \r\n* Did you notice this immediately after updating to 15.9.3?\r\n* Were you on 15.9.2 before?\r\n* Does this happen for all solutions, or only some? What about a trivial new project?\r\n* If you check out an old version of your code do you see the same problem?",

Good to hear it actually reaches someone.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know I don't use MSBuild outside of visual studio.  I'll try to remove it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly when I installed 15.9.3.  I would assume the beginning of this week. The issues started presenting themselves on Wednesday.  At least that's when I noticed it get bad enough that it was making development difficult.\r\nYes, I was previously on 15.9.2.\r\nI've only been using 2 solutions recently.  1 is mostly just class library projects, EF and web.api.  That one builds fine.  The one I'm having issues with is a front end website project so heavy on MVC, web.api, angular, javascript, etc.  That is the one with issues.  \r\n\r\nIs there a way to have MSbuild be verbose when it is executing or export a log?  Maybe it is something MSBuild is executing or a certain task it is taking a long time on and seeing that may quickly narrow down the cause. ",

The easiest is Tools -> Options -> Build and Run -> \"MSBuild project build output verbosity\" (set it to `Diagnostic`). Then the \"Output\" pane in VS will get very detailed logs when you do explicit build actions. Implicit build actions (like switching configurations) are harder to get information from but since you said this happened with build, I'd start there.",

        "body": "I've been doing testing.  I don't think the issue is isolated to MSBuild as far as I can tell.  It does however seem to be isolated to a single solution.\r\n\r\nFor this solution, the behavior I'm seeing is when I open the solution in VS, VS goes not responding for several minutes before I can use it.  This also happens when closing the solution, when executing a build, and when using msdeploy via publish it freezes prior to requesting authentication and at the very end of the publish before it marks it in the output window as complete.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions how I can troubleshoot VS to see what it is having issues with?  I'm not seeing any visible errors or errors during the build output that are pointing me in the right direction.  I think I need more of VS application diagnostic logging..",

After running the build logging it shows the MVC project getting stuck for many minutes on the WebCompiler.CompilerBuildTask.  This is the Web Essentials 2017 less/css compiler.
