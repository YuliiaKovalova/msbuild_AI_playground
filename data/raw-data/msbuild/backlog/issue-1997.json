  "body": "When having a simple cross-targeted project, such as this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp1.1;net46</TargetFrameworks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHitting F5 always re-executes a lot of msbuild targets even if nothing has changed. For this simple project, the top-level targets are :\r\n\r\n```\r\n1>      196 ms  ResolveAssemblyReference                   2 calls\r\n1>      365 ms  ResolvePackageDependencies                 2 calls\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes building large solutions that use cross-targeting very slow, as all dependent assemblies are partially re-evaluated. This gets worse if the number of packages installed is large.",
