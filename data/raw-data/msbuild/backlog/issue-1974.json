        "body": "The message is accurate, but confusing. I think we should consider updating the string `Reference found at search path location` to make it less confusing.\r\n\r\nDetailed explanation:\r\n\r\nThe `ResolveAssemblyReferences` task has many means to transform its input items into paths to files on disk. They are documented in the `SearchPaths` input in the [`ResolveAssemblyReference` Task documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/resolveassemblyreference-task) (I just submitted https://github.com/Microsoft/visualstudio-docs/pull/82 to hopefully make the documentation a bit clearer). The different `SearchPaths` are tried one at a time for each reference until the reference can be resolved.\r\n\r\nSince there are multiple ways that an assembly reference could be found, the logging indicates which mechanism was used. In the case from the original feedback, the mechanism that worked was an absolute file path to a location in the NuGet packages directory. The special string for absolute path resolution in `SearchPaths` is `{RawFileName}`, so RAR logged that as the relevant \"search path location\":\r\n```\r\n3> Reference found at search path location \"{RawFileName}\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nRAR also logged the full path that was located:\r\n```\r\n3> Resolved file path is \"C:\\Users\\<user>\\.nuget\\packages\\system.console\\4.3.0\\ref\\netstandard1.3\\System.Console.dll\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty confusing! It does indeed look like we forgot to variable-expand a string. We should consider changing the log message to more clearly indicate that it's logging a location _or technique_. Possibly even by special-casing the `RawFileName` entry, since the others are indeed locations.",
