  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nFileMatcher will catch IO related exceptions **but** continue the build down a different code path. This led to an incredibly confusing experience when Microsoft.IO.Redist couldn't be found while trying to expand a glob for $(Project).*.props early in the build. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4691428/157936399-17ac4fd4-5db6-4edf-a8ac-3611c8db2ce4.png)\r\n\r\nWe should probably check for special cases like FileNotFound errors on assemblies.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nRemove Microsoft.IO.Redist from MSBuild.exe's directory, attempt to build any project.",
