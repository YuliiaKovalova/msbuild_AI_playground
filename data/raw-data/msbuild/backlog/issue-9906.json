  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nWe have and will have several scenarios whereadditional files are steping into the process of the build - response file, generated code files, .editorconfig files and possibly others. We should be able to handle all of those cases with single structured event (defining file path, optional contnet and file usage reason).\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nOnce doing this - it would be beneficial to transfer the existing `ResponseFileUsedEventArgs` to the same model. We'd still need to keep the datamodel - but we can stop using it and mark it deprecated (to be able to get rid of it in the longer teerm)",
