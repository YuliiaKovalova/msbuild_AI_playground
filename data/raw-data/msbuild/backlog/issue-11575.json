  "title": "Move ProjectCache to non-Experimental",
  "body": "The graph and cache-plugin APIs are in the `Microsoft.Build.Experimental` namespace but are starting to have significant production use. We should \"promote\" them out of experimental.\n\nThis should _not_ be a breaking change in this version--we'll have to have new classes that forward to the new \"final\" implementation, so that existing cache plugins and graph API callers continue to work. The existing API-breaking-change checks should handle that.",
