Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n<!--\r\n* Please include a clear and concise description of the problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAllowFailureWithoutError will not prevent the error `MSB4181: The \"Microsoft.TestPlatform.Build.Tasks.VSTestTask\" task returned false but did not log an error.` when set to true. It will prevent it when set to false. The default value is true.\r\n\r\nThis option was added in #5207\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following as possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHave a task that does not write error into result, but returns false. See the MSB4181 error written to screen. Change the task and set AllowFailureWithoutError to true. See the error written to screen. Set the value to false. The error is no longer written to screen.\r\n\r\nI am seeing this in dotnet test when any test fails and try to suppress the message because we don't write the error the correct MSBuild way. https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/pull/2557 \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo not write the MSB4181 error on screen when AllowFailureWithoutError is set to true, not false. And for AllowFailureWithoutError  to default to false, not true.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMSB4181 error is written to screen when AllowFailureWithoutError is set to true, not false. AllowFailureWithoutError defaults to true.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/f2c4bfd563f559daca27ea1cd8ae40db24e2e7cd/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/TaskBuilder.cs#L941\r\n\r\nThis condition will write the MSB4181 when the condition is true. \r\n`(be is IBuildEngine7 be7 ? be7.AllowFailureWithoutError : true))` should negate AllowFailureWithoutError  like this: \r\n`(be is IBuildEngine7 be7 ? !be7.AllowFailureWithoutError : true))`.\r\n\r\nI don't know where you set the default value.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.8.0-preview-20429-01+d58e2b786 for .NET\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n<!--\r\n* If providing us a project that reproduces the issue proves difficult, consider including a binlog.\r\n* Click [here](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog) for details on sharing binary logs.\r\n* Click [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md) for more information on binary logs.\r\n    NOTE: Binlogs can contain sensitive information. Don't attach anything you don't want to be public.\r\n\r\n*   To view the contents of the binlogs yourself, you may wish to use a tool like https://msbuildlog.com/.\r\n-->",
