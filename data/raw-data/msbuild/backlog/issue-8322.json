Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\nAs I understand, MSBuild 17.5 might have broken the transformation.\r\nThe `obj` folder that should contain the transformed source code (`.cs.pp`) of a nuget package is empty - it doesn't contain the final `.cs` files where things like `$rootnamespace$` are resolved.\r\nAs an example, I have a NuGet Source Package (`BUTR.DependencyInjection` version 2.0.0.43) that stopped working.\r\nThe workarounds I saw while browsing source codes were basically \"get rid of the .pp ending\", since `.pp` was just used to hide the additional files. But how to fix it when it was used for the actual transformations?\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create an empty C# project\r\n2. Add `BUTR.DependencyInjection` version 2.0.0.43\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n`.pp` files should be correctly transformed into `.cs` files\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n`.pp` files are not correctly transformed into `.cs` files\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nVS2022\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.1+9a89d02ff for .NET Framework\r\n17.4.1.60106\r\n\r\nVS2022 Preview\r\nMSBuild version 17.5.0-preview-23053-01+ac0911a00 for .NET Framework\r\n17.5.0.5301\r\n\r\nVS2019\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.11.2+f32259642 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nHappens in VS2019/VS2022/VS2022 Preview.\r\nHappens on Rider too when MSBuild is used.\r\n\r\nThe computer I'm using is a fresh install. It does work still on my older one, ~~but it's I guess because I didn't upgrade yet, it's version is 17.4+9a89d02ff~~\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nThe version of MSBuild seems to be the same for the working one and the broken one when using VS2022, the MSBuild versions of VS2019 is 16.\r\nAfter verifying this, I have no idea what is causing this.\r\nAlso, to add to the confusion, when Rider is switched to use MSBuild, the same issue happens there too.",
