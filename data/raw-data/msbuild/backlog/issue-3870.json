  "title": "MSBuild should not delete empty environment variables",
  "body": "Windows APIs let you set empty environment variables. MSBuild is using native calls to read the environment variables, but using .net apis to restore the environment variables after a build. .net apis delete an environment variable, thus when msbuild tries to restore the empty environment variables it ends up deleting them. These would be unexpected side effects. One response to this side effect is that our [TestEnvironment ](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/a847f05896f2a0bd7ca156564765a1539de95e3f/src/Shared/UnitTests/TestEnvironment.cs) fails the test invariant check that the environment variables remain the same after a test has run.\r\n\r\nThe PR that intended to fix this still fails: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/3866\r\nIt is investigate with more debug logic here: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/3863\r\n\r\nThe hacky workaround to get our tests going again was to make TestEnvironment ignore environment variable deletions: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/exp/net472/src/Shared/UnitTests/TestEnvironment.cs#L372-L374\r\n\r\nWe should:\r\n- remove the TestEnvironment workaround which gets our tests passing\r\n- investigate and fix #3866 and #3863",
