It should be fine on windows 11.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that if we make it only run if you have admin privileges and/or SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege, then it could theoretically be wrong (at least for most users), and they wouldn't even know. Indeed, this was true for creating symbolic links for quite a while.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that goal is less important than \"you should be able to run tests.\" My plan is to introduce a second test [here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8149) that explicitly checks whether you can create a symbolic link and fails with a very clear error message if not. Does that sound sufficient, or do you think we need to make this test not fail in the first place on an old Windows OS?",
