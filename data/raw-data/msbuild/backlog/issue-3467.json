The `vcxproj` includes `ToolsVersion=\"15.0\"`, so you need to use a new version of MSBuild to understand the project (and know where to find the C++ tooling).\r\n\r\nLaunching a `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017` window should set up `%PATH%` and some other variables appropriately so you get the right MSBuild.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this, because I have pretty high confidence that this is the problem. If you try these suggestions and think otherwise please comment and we can reopen this issue.",
