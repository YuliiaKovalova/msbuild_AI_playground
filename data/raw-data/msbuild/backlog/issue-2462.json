  "body": "I ran into this case where a project file was not properly modified on a build server. It was actually invalid xml (sample here : https://github.com/geeklearningio/gl-vsts-tasks-file-patch/issues/39)\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning MSB4078: The project file \"XXX.Database\\XXX.Database.sqlproj\" is not supported by MSBuild and cannot be built.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this message I assumed there was an issue with SSDT on VSTS 2017 Hosted agent images (https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-tasks/issues/5063). I think that when the xml is invalid msbuild should fail with an explicit message instead of the current misleading message. \r\n\r\nActually, if msbuild is being run against the project and not the solution, it displays a more sensible message and it fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nXXX\\XXX.Database\\XXX.Database.sqlproj(28,4): Error MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded. 'msbuild' is an undeclared prefix. Line 28, position 4.\r\n```",
