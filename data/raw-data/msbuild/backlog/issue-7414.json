  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nA regular build of a project with a missing import produces this:\r\n\r\n> msbuild /t:prepareforbuild\r\n> C:\\VS.r\\src\\configdata\\buildtargets\\Microsoft.DevDiv.TextTemplating.15.0.targets(35,3): error MSB4019: The imported project \"C:\\build\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets\" was not found. Confirm that the expression in the Import declaration \"\\build\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets\" is correct, and that the file exists on disk. [C:\\VS.r\\src\\env\\shell\\UnitTests\\InfoBadgeTests\\InfoBadgeTests.csproj]\r\n\r\nBut I have no idea how in the tree of imports this .targets file even gets attempted. \r\nSo I run `msbuild /pp:c:\\temp\\out.xml` to try to understand this. It produces no output to stdout or stderr. And the out.xml file has 0 length.\r\n\r\nNot helpful at all. Can /pp be made to skip on missing imports and simply include a commented error message or something in the out.xml at the position of the import?\r\nAnd logging a warning to stderr would be good too.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 17.2.0-preview-22116-01+7d926d7ab for .NET Framework\r\n```",
