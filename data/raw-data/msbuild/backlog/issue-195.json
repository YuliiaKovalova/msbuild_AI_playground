  "body": "This issue is to track the long-term solution to the problems I ran into in #190.  Briefly, the post-bootstrap build of MSBuild (using a just-built-from-source copy of MSBuild.exe) was failing because it tried to use a machine-installed location as `MSBuildExtensionsPath`, but that path didn't have any extensions for the just-built toolset version (14.1).\n\nI have worked around the issue for now in #193 by copying targets, props, and tasks from the `C:\\Program Files (x86)` location to the build output and overwriting them with just-built bits as necessary.  But that's not a good long-term solution:  we shouldn't require that anything at all be installed on a developer's machine; ideally everything (bootstrap MSBuild, NuGet targets and tasks, C# compiler, and so on) should come from NuGet packages that we can restore before the first build.\n",
