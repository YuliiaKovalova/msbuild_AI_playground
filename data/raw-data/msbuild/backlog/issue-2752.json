  "body": "Consider adding `EvaluationMessageEventArgs : MessageEventArgs` and use it instead of simple Message event args during evaluation. The evaluation Id is specified in the Context, but it is per project, and all evaluation messages are in a flat list under that project.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to store the File that's currently being evaluation in the EvaluationMessageEventArgs, so that we can hierarchically organize the evaluation messages in a tree per file. Ideally also include the Parent file (that caused the current file to be imported), which is null for the root project file.",
