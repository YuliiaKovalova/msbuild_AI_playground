  "body": "Looking at the enumeration `RegisteredTaskObjectLifetime.Build` which has the following [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.build.framework.registeredtaskobjectlifetime.aspx): \r\n\r\n> The registered object will be disposed when the build ends.\r\n\r\nSay I run a build on a solution.  In that context build is a bit ambiguous.  I feel like it could mean either of the following: \r\n\r\n1. When any of the individual projects within the solution complete building\r\n1. When the solution itself completes building\r\n\r\nCan MSBuild clarify which is the correct interpretation? ",

        "body": "It's the latter--when the whole build finishes.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be the former, because MSBuild doesn't know when a project is \"complete\". Another request can always come along from another project that necessitates building a new target in a project that has already built some things and returned control flow.\r\n\r\nA quick look through the code seems to confirm this--`DisposeCacheObjects(Build)` [is called](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/2634f05a660b14c64ae4e924d900dd200d5032e7/src/Build/BackEnd/Node/InProcNode.cs#L356) in node \"shutdown\" which happens in `BuildManager.EndBuild`.\r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question and make sense?",
