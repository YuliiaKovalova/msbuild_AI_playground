  "title": "MSBuild thinks a sln dependency is a reference",
  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have a .NET 4.7 project which, as part of its build, runs a .NET Core CLI program to generate one of its source files using the `BeforeBuild` target and `<Exec>`. Because of this I want the generator to build before my project, so the .sln file has a dependency in the form of `ProjectSection(ProjectDependencies) = postProject`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe build works from within VS. I expect it to work from a command line MSBuild, because I in fact don't reference the .NET Core project, just call it as any other CLI tool. The fact that it's .NET Core is irrelevant, it could be C++.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`[GetReferenceNearestTargetFrameworkTask] C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\15.0\\bin\\amd64\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1656, 5): Project 'C:\\[snip...]\\csharp_gen.csproj' targets 'netcoreapp2.1'. It cannot be referenced by a project that targets '.NETFramework,Version=v4.7'.`\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.7.179.6572 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
