  "body": "This issue tracks implementing the optimization per https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/rar-core-scenarios.md#dont-load-the-per-project-disk-cache-when-not-needed\r\n\r\nParent user story: #8422\r\n\r\nThe on disk cache is not adding any value in the hot scenario because its contents already lives in the in-memory cache. The proposal is to load it lazily only when (and if) RAR runs into an assembly that does not have a record in the in-memory cache. In developer inner loop, when the same solution is built over and over again, the cache would typically not be loaded at all, unless the developer makes a change that actually changes the dependency graph.",
