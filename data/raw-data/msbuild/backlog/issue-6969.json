Verify the parameter exists on the task, and it is a gettable public instance property.  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nI saw changes in [this commit](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/02a3a62dfc5f40c1e50a094da2f4419d11754f95#diff-b9e7e69d1865669b01c7d4230138b5ab642eeda009a16bc58358289a19675f9fR211) which perhaps make the problem.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n16.11.1.47101\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n",
