  "body": "Right now we either do a full localized build (sync xlf files AND use satellite assemblies) or not (no satellites, no sync).\n\nWe should instead do a hybrid: always generate resource assemblies, but sync xlf on demand.\n\nThis would help with:\n- create local debug nuget packages with satellites in them for testing purposes\n- increase the dev usage of satellites (catch loc infra bugs earlier)\n- xliff parser is not yet .net core compliant, so separating it out will enable us to do xplat localized builds\n",
