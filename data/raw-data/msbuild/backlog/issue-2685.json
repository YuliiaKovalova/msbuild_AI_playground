  "body": "I try to build the solution consisting of 20 projects on Windows and Linux in Debug and Release configuration using MSBuild command line. On Windows everything always works as expected. The same is for Linux for Debug configuration. However, Release configuration on Linux sometimes hangs indefinitely without producing any errors. In 90+% of cases it is the same project where building is stopped. However, sometimes it can be other projects. Probably, it is somehow timing related. There is nothing special about the projects on which building hangs, i.e. they are configured in the same way as other projects in the solution. I tried diffirent MSBuild parameters (e.g.  /p:UseSharedCompilation=false, /target:Rebuild, /target:Clean,Build, /maxcpucount:1, /nodeReuse:false, etc.) as well as their combination, but nothing resolved the issue. I can reproduce the issue only for Release configuration on Linux. If I retry building the solution at the same machine, it may succeed. Approximately 1 out 10 building attempts hangs.",
