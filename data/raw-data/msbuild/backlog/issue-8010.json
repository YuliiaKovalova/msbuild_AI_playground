  "body": "<!-- This is a template that helps us provide quicker feedback. Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\nThe issue appears when stopping a build that is currently being done in the wrong spot. The console prints: \"attempting to cancel the build\". However msbuild just gets stuck.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nI'm not quite sure how to get into this state. I have had success running multiple dotnet builds in parallel and then cancelling some of them.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n```dotnet build``` and other commands keep working.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nEither ```dotnet build``` stops working and just reports:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuild Failed.\r\n0 Warnings 0 Errors\r\n```\r\nor if you kill all running dotnet processes you can now build again but the build just gets stuck:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0-preview-22428-01+14c24b2d3 for .NET\r\n^CAttempting to cancel the build...\r\nAttempting to cancel the build...\r\n^C^C\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nI am guessing this has to do with the central build server that was introduced by net 7.0\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\ndotnet version: 7.0.100-rc.1.22431.12",

Look through that list for the one running `dotnet build` and the ones with `MSBuild.dll` in the command line (MSBuild's worker processes).\r\n\r\nThen you should be able to get memory dumps for each process with `dotnet-dump collect --process-id 59340` (insert your own PIDs).\r\n\r\nNote that memory dumps may contain information you don't want to share in public, depending on your machine environment and your projects. If you'd like only Microsoft employees to see your dump, you can [open a Visual Studio feedback ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/feedback-options) and attach the .dmp files in private.",
