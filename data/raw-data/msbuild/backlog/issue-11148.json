  "body": "### Summary\n\nEnabling hooking of custom telemetry exporting/collection would be useful for customers who want simple observability of builds with OpenTelemetry.\nIn core hooking OpenTelemetry can be achieved with a Startup Hook https://github.com/baronfel/otel-startup-hook/, in Framework it has to use some workarounds.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11013\n- it is one of the goals\n\nPrecondition for the utility of this feature is to have data points instrumented with System.Diagnostics Activities. https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10946\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nhttps://github.com/JanProvaznik/otel-startup-hook/tree/doublehook\n\nProductize this demo (probably as a repo with instructions how to use in MSBuild).\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\nIt could be implemented as part of Microsoft.Build.Framework but that would increase our reliance on OpenTelemetry packages.",
