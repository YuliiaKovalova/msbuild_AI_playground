  "title": "[Bug]: Transitive ProjectReference copied even when hidden with PrivateAssets",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIf I have app.csproj > lib2.csproj >(private) lib1.csproj\r\n\r\nlib1 should not be present in the output of directory of app, but it is.  This is due to RAR's `FindDependencies` behavior.  It sees the reference from lib2 to lib1 in metadata, and see's lib1 in lib2's output directory, so it's added to copy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's no public property to control RAR's `FindDependencies` parameter.  One can specify `_FindDependencies`, as mentioned here to workaround:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/8215fb194d24cba1971476188ad97e5498fd2dfb/documentation/wiki/ResolveAssemblyReference.md?plain=1#L40-L45C1\r\n\r\n`_FindDependencies` isn't publicly documented, nor is there any way to disable this copying as far as I can tell.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nBuild attached repro.\r\n[privateProjectRef.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/13868644/privateProjectRef.zip)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nlib1.dll does not appear in app's output.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nlib1.dll is copied to app's output.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

That project also wants it's dependencies copied to the output - that's why it uses `PrivateAssets` instead of `ExcludeAssets` or `Private`.\r\n",
