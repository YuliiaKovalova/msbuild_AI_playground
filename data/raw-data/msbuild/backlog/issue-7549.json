  "title": "Adopt RequiresPreviewFeatures instead of Experimental namespace",
  "body": "When pushing preview API surface that we don't expect to stabilize in a release, we have historically put it in a special `Microsoft.Build.Experimental` namespace, to indicate to consumers that the usual backward-compatibility guarantees did not apply. The .NET platform now has a [`RequiresPreviewFeatures` attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.runtime.versioning.requirespreviewfeaturesattribute) that can be used to indicate the same, without the final \"promotion to production-ready\" change being a breaking change. We should consider using it for new experimental features and potentially moving everything that is currently in the Experimental namespace to the new mechanism.",

        "body": "Discussed adopting the RequiresPreviewFeatures attribute online. Resolution: Nothing prevents us to have it for .NET Core version, so let's do it. However, we target .NET Framework as well and for attribute to work properly there (i.e. analyzer is triggered) we would need to introduce additional NuGet dependency on the analyzer package. That does not seem a good option at the moment. So, better to continue to use the `Microsoft.Build.Experimental` namespace in general.",
