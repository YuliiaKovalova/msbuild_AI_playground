  "body": "Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Copy supports UseHardlinksIfPossible property. Unfortunately, using this property causes the issue with coping the files originally located at TFS _(workspace location should be set to Server)_. This task clears all attributes of a destination files, but in case of hard link original and destination files are the same, so original files also changes their attributes (especially readonly one).\n\nAnd next time on updating TFS can cause conflicting issue, because in Server mode workspace lack of readonly attribute means that the file has been changed and needed for merging. \n\nI'd advise to perform small change at 351 line of Cope.cs file, something like this:\n\n`if (sourceFileState.IsReadOnly && !hardLinkCreated)`\n\nOr better implement additional property which will indicate what we should do with hard links attributes. \n",
