  "body": "### Context\r\n#8826 \r\n\r\nIn order to be able to remove Microsoft.Build.Engine, the dependant teams need to migrate to [Project](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/Definition/Project.cs) or [BuildManager](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs) APIs.\r\n\r\nMSBuild team might need to partner with some of those teams to help them migrate\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n* SSDT team offboarded: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/2078181\r\n* WorkFlows (owned by F# team) offboarded: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/2090889\r\n\r\n### Suggested approach\r\nWork with teams to get them\r\n* evaluate what parts of the code are actually being used (we already resolved couple cases where code or whole feature was eventually confirmed dead and just removed)\r\n* evaluate what is the usage(s) trying to achieve (high level)\r\n* have a workable test case(s) and workable dev instructions so that the work can be done without knowledge of the codebase and processes\r\n\r\nOnce this is setup, then next step is to change the used code to reference API from Microsoft.Build package.\r\n ",
