If a project really is invalid, then MSBuild will complain about it, so the error will be noticed and fixed, and the schema is not needed for that.",

It's more important for a developer to have valid intellisense and help for the options that *do* exist, especially if they choose to use something other than Visual Studio for editing, and as you said, if they did in fact misspell something, that'll get caught at runtime, so I'm still not seeing the downside of enabling xs:any.",
