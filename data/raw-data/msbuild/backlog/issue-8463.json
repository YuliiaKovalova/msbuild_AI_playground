  "body": "As a perf optimization MSBuild can filter out verbose log output very early to speed up the build if no logger interested in low importance messages is enabled. LiveLogger is currently not recognized by this system, making it slower than the default console logger as configured in `dotnet build`.\r\n\r\nIt should be as simple as adding a case here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/dfd8f413a80cd0865f968b2c0ad9b09c0df8c430/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Logging/LoggingService.cs#L1630-L1644\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, LL must not actually consume any low importance messages for this to work.",

By parsing low-pri messages we can get lots of state that isn't exposed in a more structured way today. But I don't know of any concrete need for that on our to-do list right now, and would be happy to cross that bridge when we come to it (with the possibility of solving the problem by adding better-structured messages).",
