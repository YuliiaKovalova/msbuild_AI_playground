  "title": "NuGet package build logic ignored under some obj customizations",
  "body": "If you're in a situation where you want to customize the obj directory (`IntermediateOutputPath`) path, you may run into a situation where the build ignores packages' .props and .targets files.\r\n\r\nThis happens if you assign a value to `IntermediateOutputPath` _after_ importing `Microsoft.Common.props`, which is easy to do, especially with Sdk imports.\r\n\r\n```csproj\r\n<Project Sdk=\"something\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <!-- This is bad! -->\r\n    <IntermediateOutputPath>SomeCustomValue</IntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason this causes silent errors is that NuGet restore happens at the solution level. Restore asks each project for some information, and gets the _final_ value of the obj directory, after the top-to-bottom evaluation of the project, so it gets the customized value. NuGet then generates .props and .targets files in that location.\r\n\r\nWhen the actual build begins, `Microsoft.Common.props` attempts to import the generated file from the _default_ obj location, because at the time of the import, the property hasn't been set to its custom value. No file is present in that location and the build silently continues, with no NuGet-package-delivered customizations.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nCustomize the obj directory using [`Directory.Build.props`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build), or another mechanism that sets `BaseIntermediateOutputPath` _before_ the `MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath` in `Microsoft.Common.props`.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcdd Note: doing this means that you do not have access to very many properties that are set to defaults in the imported props. Be careful to use only built-in properties or constants, and not rely on things like `$(AssemblyName)`.",

Also Please don't put something in that folder, if you need put something in it, just give us another property for put an address for another place.\r\n\r\nWhat is \"obj\" folder for?   google tell us: **The \"obj\" folder is used to store temporary object files and other files used in order to create the final binary during the compilation process. The \"bin\" folder is the output folder for complete binaries (assemblies).**\r\n\r\nSo please don't cofuse about temporary files and permanent files. We need to separate it, I thought you guys gave us `MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath` for put some permanent files(at least will not change too frequently)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n    <OutputPath>Y:\\Cache\\$(MSBuildProjectName)\\$(Configuration)</OutputPath>\r\n    <MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\\..\\Extentions</MSBuildProjectExtensionsPath>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>Y:\\Cache\\$(MSBuildProjectName)\\obj\\$(Configuration)</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut after that it told me that's wrong again....Don't know what you guys want to do....",
