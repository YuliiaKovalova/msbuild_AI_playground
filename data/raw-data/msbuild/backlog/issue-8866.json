There is no `/Project` switch to MSBuild. The `/p` (or `/property`) switch defines a property and expects _name=value_. But there is no `$(project)` property.\r\n\r\nThe `devenv` command when given the [`/build` switch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/build-devenv-exe?view=vs-2022), requires a solution file. The `/project` switch can be provided to specify a project within the solution. MSBuild doesn't work like that.\r\n\r\nMSBuild can be given a solution file (in which case it synthesizes a meta project from the solution) or it can be given a project file. You cannot give MSBuild a solution file and a project within the solution file.\r\n\r\nBut you can give MSBuild a solution file and specify a target scoped to a project within the project file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsbuild  .\\my.sln /t:myproject:build ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs @KalleOlaviNiemitalo stated see \"[Build specific targets in solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-build-specific-targets-in-solutions-by-using-msbuild-exe?view=vs-2022)\".",
