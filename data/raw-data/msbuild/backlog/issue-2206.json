  "body": "[ResxEol.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1065444/ResxEol.zip)\r\n\r\nThe attached program behaves differently if you compile it with core msbuild vs. full msbuild. The root cause is that there is a resx value with a newline in it. The resx file is saved with Windows CR LF format. Core MSBuild write LF to the .resources file while full msbuild writes CR LF.  (More generally, full msbuild preserves the EOL character of the document,)\r\n\r\nI believe it gets read with only LF here: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/afd0c573175e57f602462d165113a5f51b3fd7b2/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L2912\r\n\r\nAnd XDocument is just respecting the Xml specification: https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-line-ends\r\n\r\nI didn't dig in to how ResxResourceReader on full msbuild manages to preserve the line ending.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
