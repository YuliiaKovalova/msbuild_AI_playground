  "title": "VSIX Incremental Build is Broken",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nRunning `build.cmd -pack` should always generate new vsix packages when there's something new to build. Today it looks as if incremental build specifically for these packages is broken in some way, or doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n`build.cmd -pack`\r\nmake a change\r\n`build.cmd -pack`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nAll generated VSIX's get overwritten when relevant\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nNo new VSIX is generated, or it's generated with stale bits (can't confirm, but I suspect)",
