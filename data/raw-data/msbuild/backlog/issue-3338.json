Sometimes, it's not 100% full-fidelity (i.e. it will modify the newlines in attributes you might have carefully crafted). \r\n\r\nIn addition, sometimes you just want to keep the declarative project structure and props in the csproj, and leave the augmented behavior in a separate `.targets` file alongside the project (I do this all the time for VSIX projects, for example, or to separate the packaging aspects from the build aspects of the project).\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if the Common.props and Common.targets already imported those files automatically, like:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\$(MSBuildProjectName).props\"\r\n        Condition=\"Exists('$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\$(MSBuildProjectName).props')\" />\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```xml\r\n<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\$(MSBuildProjectName).targets\"\r\n        Condition=\"Exists('$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\$(MSBuildProjectName).targets')\" />\r\n```\r\n",
