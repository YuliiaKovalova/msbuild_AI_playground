Your Windows build log shows\n\n```\n  Restored D:\\a\\1\\s\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1.csproj (in 170 ms).\n  Test1= true\" Test2=true\n  ClassLibrary1 -> D:\\a\\1\\s\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1\\bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\ClassLibrary1.dll\n  Test1= true\" Test2=true\n```\n\nwhere the value of Test1 clearly includes a quotation mark.  And the Linux build log has\n\n```\n  Restored /home/vsts/work/1/s/ClassLibrary1/ClassLibrary1/ClassLibrary1.csproj (in 116 ms).\n  Test1= true Test2=false\n  ClassLibrary1 -> /home/vsts/work/1/s/ClassLibrary1/ClassLibrary1/bin/Debug/net8.0/ClassLibrary1.dll\n  Test1= true Test2=false\n```\n\nwithout the quotation mark.\n\n(The space between `Test1=` and `true` comes from your MSBuild code.)\n\n",
