  "body": "Thought you might want to be aware of this, but in Roslyn/ProjectSystem's settings.targets (which occurs *before* common.targets), we have the following:\r\n\r\n``` XML\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath Condition=\"'$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)' == ''\">$([System.IO.Path]::GetFullPath('$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\\..\\..\\bin\\obj\\$(MSBuildProjectName)'))\\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis used to set the base intermediate directory, unless an individual project overwrote it. \r\n\r\nIn recent builds of MSBuild, however, we now respect the base intermediate directory (\"obj\\\") that comes from Microsoft.Common.props. This means that by upgrading to MSBuild 15, our build output has now changed.",
