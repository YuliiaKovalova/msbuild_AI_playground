  "body": "Follow up to #10398.\r\n\r\nThe following members are invoked on a `dotnet build` and/or `dotnet publish` of the console and web templates and forced to fallback to the reflection-based lookups:\r\n\r\n| ReceiverType | ObjectInstanceType | MethodName |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Microsoft.Build.Utilities.ToolLocationHelper| | GetPlatformSDKLocation(String, String) |\r\n| Microsoft.Build.Utilities.ToolLocationHelper| | GetPlatformSDKDisplayName(String, String) |\r\n\r\nIt's not trivial to fix these with the existing fast-path operations, because we probably do not want to add a dependency between `Microsoft.Build` and `Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core` now when it hasn't been there for many years.",
