  "title": "[Bug]: Build succeeds even though Errors were raised",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nAs part of the dotnet/aspnetcore test build, we are publishing test apps and running them during the build. If the test app doesn't return the correct ExitCode, we fail the build.\r\n\r\nHowever, we've run into situations where raising this `Error` doesn't fail the build, even though it should. This happens in CI, but we haven't found a case where it happens locally - if the test fails, the build fails locally.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSee the binlog here: [aspnetcore-succeeds-buterror.binlog](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/eerhardt/EfHRSjLe-NNItqw8qIZP5J4B7VkPpcbYjozFxwgQ0E4xhg?e=B6EIrw)\r\n\r\nHere is the MSBuild code raising an error:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/81666eef98bd9e8c4d95c1478ebe4d4ba77e61a3/eng/testing/linker/trimmingTests.targets#L121-L125\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe whole build should fail because an `Error` occurred during the build.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/8291187/5de355b5-0ef1-49d1-bb2d-eb0a5cfe619a)\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
