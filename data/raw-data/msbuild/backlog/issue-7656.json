  "body": "Copied from doc issue https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/issues/6274 entered by @stpatrick2016:\r\n\r\nWhen running msbuild from the command line and specifying property with -p, it overrides project properties. It is possible to cancel such behavior by setting TreatAsLocalProperty. It works correctly with the old csproj format but seems has no effect on projects with the new SDK format.\r\n\r\nTried that with VS2017 and property OutDir",

Were you importing it? Where did you check if its value had been overridden properly? I'm assuming you were building with VS, correct? Does it also repro for you from the command line?",
