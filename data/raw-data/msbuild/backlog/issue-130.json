But\nI am wondering whether the tests should be using native paths or windows paths\n(except in the rooted case, of course).\n\nIn case of project files which get parsed by msbuild, it makes sense to always\nuse always windows paths and let msbuild correctly translate them to native\nones. But in the test cases, api/tasks/etc are used directly, which might not\nbe converting them.\n\nShould they be changed to always translate? But then there would be a _lot_ of\npoints at which we would need to do that (every public API?!).  Or should the\ntests use native paths when using API directly, and use windows paths when\nspecifying them in text/project files that get parsed?\n",
