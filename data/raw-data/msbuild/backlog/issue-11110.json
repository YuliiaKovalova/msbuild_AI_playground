  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nDiscovered in https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2664, passing `/p:IntermediateOutputPath=` with an absolute path causes the exe of a referenced project to be overwritten by the project referencing it.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a C# console app project\n```cs\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World from ConsoleApp1\");\n```\n2. Create a second C# console app project\n```cs\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World from ConsoleApp2\");\n```\n3. Add a project reference to the second project from the first project\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\ConsoleApp2\\ConsoleApp2.csproj\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n4. Build the project with dotnet sdk, passing absolute output paths.\n```cmd\ndotnet build -c Release /p:IntermediateOutputPath=C:\\Users\\Tim\\source\\repos\\BuildPathBug\\obj/\n```\n5. Run the produced `ConsoleApp2.exe` in the bin directory of ConsoleApp1.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nIf I also include `/p:OutDir=` so that both projects output to the same bin directory, the `ConsoleApp2.exe` is correct if I do not include `/p:IntermediateOutputPath=`, and incorrect if I do include it.\nLikewise, with both `/p:IntermediateOutputPath=` and `/p:OutDir=` included, the `ConsoleApp2.exe` is correct if I do not include the project reference in step 3, and incorrect if it is included.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nConsole prints `Hello World from ConsoleApp2`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n\nConsole prints `Hello World from ConsoleApp1`.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nmsbuild -version\n```cmd\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.6.0 for Mono\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\n16.6.0.22901\n```\n\ndotnet --version\n```cmd\n9.0.101\n```",

        "body": "This seems to be expected behaviour within MSBuild, anything on intermediate output path will be rewritten during the build. To avoid that you can pass a relative path depending on the built project instead.\n\nWe do need to write better docs about this case. Probably within [the project properties learn page](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-properties).",
