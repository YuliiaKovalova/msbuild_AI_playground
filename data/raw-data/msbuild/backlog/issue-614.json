  "body": "As many issues have documented (and come up with questionable solutions) editing MSBuild files by had is hard, even with XSD which there isn't always.\n\nWhile I'm not completely sure how (part of the reason for this issue) I think the editing experience needs to be improved.\n\nAn example would be that since Tasks are backed by .NET classes why not parse them and expose they type data from them and if available XML documentation?\n",

I have not used the tool for many years and have no clue if it has been maintained or what the experience is with the tooling.\n",
