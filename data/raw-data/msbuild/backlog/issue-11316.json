  "body": "\n### Context\n\nWe are planning to employ sampling of telemetry data. Over time there will be ability to tune the sampling or/and control it more granularly based on source type or measured population.\nIn order to properly interpret the data when reviewing in backend - we need to know what sample size does the data represent.\n\n### Suggested implementation\n\nAdd 'Cardinality' property that will be storing the acutal sampling rate used at the time of collection.",
