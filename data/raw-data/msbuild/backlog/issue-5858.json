Unfortunately thats not the case. The TestIssueTarget is always executed, even if the build system detected that GenerateNuspec can be skipped.\r\n\r\nIf this is the intended behavior, how can I achieve what I am aiming to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So whether a target skipped is not observable outside that target. What you can do is add inputs and outputs to your target with an input that is output by the `GenerateNuspec` target.",
