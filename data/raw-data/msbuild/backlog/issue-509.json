  "body": "This was discovered internally by @AArnott. Thanks for the report and for giving us access to that repro machine.\n\nMSBuild ships with an empty `msbuild.rsp` next to `msbuild.exe` in Program Files. If edited, any line in this response file is effectively prepended to the command line of a normal, undecorated `msbuild` invocation. Presumably this is to allow easily setting defaults for MSBuild across the entire machine.\n\nSince #346, if this response file contains `/nr:false` to disable node reuse, multiproc builds will a) actually use only one process while b) continually spawning new instances of `msbuild.exe /nodeMode:1` until that one process completes.\n\nThis is because cc051cb9d4fb8507144aabdd7bfbc44669c862d2 changed how the child/client/worker node handled the `/nodeReuse` command line switch. Before, it was ignored and the child process would always live until it was sent a kill signal or it hit its timeout. After, it uses the value of the switch (after response-file inclusion, and defaulting to true) as part of its handshake computation.\n\nIn this situation, the main MSBuild spawned a new child process with no `/nodeReuse` flag, which in the absence of a response file is equivalent to `/nodeReuse:true`. Since there _was_ a response file, the child actually started with `/nodeReuse:false`, computed its handshake value using that, and rejected the connection attempt that wanted `/nodeReuse:true`. For every attempted child process, in a loop, until the build ended.\n",
