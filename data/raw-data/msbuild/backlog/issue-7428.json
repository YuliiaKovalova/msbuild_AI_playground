  "title": "Enhancement: Add System.Environment::NewLine as a supported static property",
  "body": "### Description\r\nMSBuild currently doesn't seem to provide the 'native' line ending for the current OS. (Did I miss a property or function that provides the line ending for the platform?)\r\n\r\nThere is a set of static methods and properties exposed including the `System.Environment::CommandLine` property (see [Static property functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/property-functions?view=vs-2022#static-property-functions)). Adding support for the `System.Environment::NewLine` property would provide the line ending for the current OS which would support greater portability for MSBuild scripts.\r\n\r\ne.g., displaying an ItemGroup as one item per line could be written as:\r\n```\r\n<Message Text=\"@(stuff, '$([System.Environment]::NewLine)')\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example code currently generates an error:\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4185: The function \"NewLine\" on type \"System.Environment\" is not available for execution as an MSBuild property function.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA less portable version of the example code is the following which hard-codes the \\r\\n for Windows:\r\n```\r\n<Message Text=\"@(stuff, '%0d%0a')\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more portable workaround would be:\r\n```\r\n<PropertyGroup\r\n    <IsWindows>$([System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::IsOSPlatform($([System.Runtime.InteropServices.OSPlatform]::Windows)))</IsWindows>\r\n    <Newline Condition=\"$(IsWindows)\">%0d%0a</Newline>\r\n    <Newline Condition=\"$(Newline) == ''\">%0a</Newline>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n<Message Text=\"@(stuff, '$(Newline)')\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nChecked on v16.10.1.58001\r\n",
