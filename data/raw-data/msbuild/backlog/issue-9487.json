However the errors have a good landing pages that would be nice to returned. We might need to get together with the team maintaining the links experience about what are the expectations on errors returned by us (as sdk or nuget errors that lead to proper landing page, have their errorcode inside the search term argument in the url)",

And the point of the help links is to help track the usage of these links to prioritize creating and updating content?\r\n\r\nIf so, I don't think there's an all-up problem here - just a task list that we could help burn down.",
