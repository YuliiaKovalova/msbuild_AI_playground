  "body": "The [MainNodeSdkResolverService](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/SdkResolution/MainNodeSdkResolverService.cs) handles requests for SDK resolution from out-of-proc nodes with a queue.  However, requests are coming in via NodeManager which already has a queue of packets to be handled.  The `MainNodeSdkResolverService` could instead just use `Task.Run()` to launch a thread which processes the request and sends the response.  This would get rid of this entire handler pump proc:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/a70ee3087277b8d5c908d911ffca0e5deb19ecd5/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/SdkResolution/MainNodeSdkResolverService.cs#L192-L213\r\n\r\nThe threads running to handle requests should also set their name (which is helpful when working in the debugger):\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nThread.CurrentThread.Name = \"Processing SDK request {request.Name} for node {nodeId}\";\r\n```\r\n",
