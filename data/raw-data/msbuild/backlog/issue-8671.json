  "body": "We were discussing the right home for docs that represent proposed-but-not-yet-accepted designs. It's nice to be able to check them in as point-in-time artifacts and close PRs creating them, even if we're not going to move forward with a specific plan right now.\r\n\r\nWe currently have `documentation/specs` and `documentation/design`.\r\n\r\nWe should unify those and have a `proposed` or `working` folder.\r\n\r\nProposal from @JanKrivanek:\r\n\r\n* `documentation/specs` is \"accepted\"\r\n* `documentation/specs/proposed` is \"not accepted, still working or paused\"\r\n* `documentation/specs/archive` is \"explicitly rejected with reasoning for posterity\".\r\n\r\nThat works for me.",
