  "body": "NuGet restores are typically done at the solution level. With the move to msbuild there needs to be a way to run _msbuild /t:restore Solution.sln_\n\nToday this can work when adding Before.{sln}.targets to add restore to the metaproj. However this isn't an option for the dotnet restore/NuGet tools. \n\nTo support this it looks like the restore target needs to be added into the default metaproj, or a generic hook that could be used to load targets without having to use Before.{sln}.targets.\n\nThe current restore target is part of ImportsAfter for the CLI and allows projects to be restored using _msbuild /t:restore project.csproj_\n\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/792f2b197f097fe4a0993912b0e7d6ec50cfc5e5/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/NuGet.targets\n",
