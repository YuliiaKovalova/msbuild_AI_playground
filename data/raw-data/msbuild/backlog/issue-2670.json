  "body": "When building a project in Visual Studio that has a custom task, the assembly containing the custom task is locked by MSBuild until the Visual Studio is closed and the process exits. Is there any way to get MSBuild to shadow copy the custom task assembly or unload the assembly, so that the original file is not locked and can be overwritten without closing VS?\r\n\r\nWe have in our csproj:\r\n```\r\n<UsingTask AssemblyFile=\"Path\\To\\MyTask.dll\" TaskName=\"MyTask\"/>\r\n<Target Name=\"AfterBuild\">\r\n  <MyTask/>\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would like the Path\\To\\MyTask.dll file to not be locked following a completed build of the csproj within Visual Studio.\r\n",

My Task Assembly remains locked until i close VS \r\nHave this with VS 2019 16.10 on netcoreapp3.1 and net5.0.\r\nI am missing something here?",
