  "title": "Need Solution File extensibility point that works for multiple solution files",
  "body": "# Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, MSBuild generates an in memory \"metaproj\" representation of a Visual Studio Solution File.  This metaproj can be extended with two mechanisms:\r\n\r\n1. Place a file in `$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\\SolutionFile\\ImportBefore` and/or `$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\\SolutionFile\\ImportAfter`\r\n2. Create a file named `before.MySolution.sln.targets` and/or `after.MySolution.sln.targets`\r\n\r\nThe first extensibility mechanism is machine wide and requires elevated privileges to write to.  The second extensibility mechanism requires a file per Solution File.\r\n\r\nWe need a third extensibility point for the metaproj similar to `Directory.Build.props`/`Directory.Build.targets`.  This mechanism is per repository and would apply to the building of all Solution Files rather than each one.\r\n\r\n## Design Spec\r\n\r\nThe metaproj should import a file named `Directory.Solution.props` at the top and a file named `Directory.Solution.targets` at the bottom.  We cannot reuse `Directory.Build.props` or `Directory.Build.targets` because those files already exist today and if the next version of MSBuild started importing them when building a Solution File then it could be a breaking change.\r\n\r\nUsers can opt to have their `Directory.Solution.props` simply import `Directory.Build.props` so it wouldn't end up being that much overhead for users who want to adopt the feature.  On the plus side, having a separate file for extending metaproj versus every project in the tree would mean users wouldn't have to condition everything in the single file.  \r\n\r\nIt should be possible to disable each import with the following properties:\r\n\r\n1. `ImportDirectorySolutionProps`\r\n2. `ImportDirectorySolutionTargets`\r\n\r\nAnd users can specify a custom full path file name if they don't want to use the default:\r\n\r\n1. `DirectorySolutionPropsPath`\r\n2. `DirectorySolutionTargetsPath`\r\n\r\nFinally, the feature should be documented here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build\r\n\r\nRelated to #222\r\nFollows in the footsteps of #751\r\n\r\n\r\n",
