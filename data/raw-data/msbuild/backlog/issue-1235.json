  "body": "It would be nice to have MSBuild to be able to handle building projects that are in those formats and to loop for solution files inside of them before resorting to the project filese themselve weather a C++ project file or not. This would help make things a whole lot easier to clean after building and a lot easier to package changes that people can then download and build from that archive itself without needing to extract first.\n",
