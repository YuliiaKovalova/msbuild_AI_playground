  "body": "To bootstrap, Microsoft.Common.CrossTargeting.targets imports $(CoreCrossTargetingTargetsPath) variable, but we need a mechanism like Microsoft.Common.targets participation for nuget packages. Targets should opt in to being in the cross-targeting build.\n\n@srtivatsn and I discussed an approach where msbuild would import the same projects from Common and Common.CrossTargeting, but nuget would generate appropriate conditions based on IsCrossTargetingBuild. And packages would put their cross-targeting targets in build\\cross folder.\n\ncc @jeffkl \n",
