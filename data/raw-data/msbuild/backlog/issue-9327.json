  "title": "[Bug]: Overrides of Predefined Targets Defined in the Project File are not Run in SDK projects",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe documentation at \"[Override predefined targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-extend-the-visual-studio-build-process?view=vs-2022#override-predefined-targets)\" lists predefined targets that can be overridden, e.g. `BeforeBuild` and `AfterBuild`.\r\n\r\nOverrides of these predefined targets are not run in an SDK style project (but are run in a Legacy style project).\r\n\r\nThe full list in the documentation is:\r\n\r\n`BeforeCompile`\r\n`AfterCompile`\r\n`BeforeBuild`\r\n`AfterBuild`\r\n`BeforeRebuild`\r\n`AfterRebuild`\r\n`BeforeClean`\r\n`AfterClean`\r\n`BeforePublish`\r\n`AfterPublish`\r\n`BeforeResolveReferences`\r\n`AfterResolveReferences`\r\n`BeforeResGen`\r\n`AfterResGen`\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a new C# console app project.\r\n2. Modify the .csproj file to include the following:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"BeforeBeforeBuild\" BeforeTargets=\"BeforeBuild\">\r\n    <Message Text=\">> BeforeBeforeBuild target\"/>\r\n  </Target>\r\n\r\n  <Target Name=\"AfterBeforeBuild\" AfterTargets=\"BeforeBuild\">\r\n    <Message Text=\">> AfterBeforeBuild target\"/>\r\n  </Target>\r\n\r\n  <Target Name=\"BeforeBuild\">\r\n    <Message Text=\">> BeforeBuild target\"/>\r\n    <Touch Files=\"touched.txt\" AlwaysCreate=\"true\"/>\r\n  </Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Build the project with `-v:n`.\r\n\r\nThe log will show the messages from the `BeforeBeforeBuild` and `AfterBeforeBuild` targets but not the message from the `BeforeBuild` target override and the touched.txt file will not be created.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBeforeBeforeBuild:\r\n  >> BeforeBeforeBuild target\r\nAfterBeforeBuild:\r\n  >> AfterBeforeBuild target\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Move the `BeforeBuild` target override to a `Directory.Build.targets` file and the target will work.\r\n\r\nWith `-v:d` the log shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOverriding target \"BeforeBuild\" in project \"***\\ConsoleApp1.csproj\" with target \"BeforeBuild\" from project \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently in Legacy style projects the 'Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets' file is imported before the content of the project file and in SDK style projects the 'Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets' file is imported after the content of the project file.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFrom the documentation and prior behavior, a target override within the project file should work.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe special pre-defined targets can't be overridden.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe \"pre-definitions\" of the targets occur too late in an SDK style project.\r\n\r\nPossible resolutions:\r\n\r\n- Move the pre-definitions of the targets from \"Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\" to a file that is imported before the project content.\r\n- Update the documentation appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe documentation could explain that in an SDK style project the overrides can't be in the project file.\r\n\r\nMy own practice is to use these predefined targets in `AfterTargets`, `BeforeTargets`, and `DependsOnTargets` attributes and to never override. (That largely derives from an issue where an override was overridden :slightly_frowning_face:.)\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
