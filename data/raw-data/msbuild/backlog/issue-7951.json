  "title": "Fix aggressive caching of immutable files for ARM64 architecture",
  "body": "The aggressive caching of immutable files (introduced in #6974) does not work for arm64 scenarios because locations of immutable files for this architecture are different. So, we do not benefit from this optimization in arm64 scenarios. We want to revisit PR #6974 and more specifically the [FileClassifier.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/518c041f4511a6bc23eb40703b69a94ea46c65fd/src/Framework/FileClassifier.cs) to fix that.",
