  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI've attached two .sln files and some binlogs\r\nhttps://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/stevenki/EixvC6_FBmRAqUopltGOtA0B5_f46g0zwGsgcfttI25jhg?e=a4sTuS\r\n\r\nYou can open each .sln in Visual Studio and F5 them. For App6, you'll need to make sure the `WapProjTemplate1` project is the startup project.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9649518/81350016-f7baa880-9075-11ea-87c6-4aa3e2540f2a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9649518/81350307-7f081c00-9076-11ea-8605-a39300475d36.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n\r\nc:\\Users\\stevenki\\source\\repos>msbuild /version\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.7.0-preview-20228-06+9571f7584 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n16.7.0.22806\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows Insider build 20124\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc): \r\nVS: 16.7.0 Preview 1.0 [30104.155.master]\r\nDotnet CLI: N/A (apps can't build w/ dotnet cli)\r\n\r\n### Cause\r\nWhat I found in my investigation, is that the `ResolveAssemblyReferences` task is supposed to return the .pri in the `_ReferenceRelatedPaths` item group. However, even though the .pri extension is passed in as an allowed extension, that isn't being respected. From there, it's a chain reaction that's basically causing the .pri file to not be merged into the apps .pri, which results in xaml files not being found at runtime",
