If it was possible to use single `EvaluationContext` for the whole lifetime of our long running service that would fix the leak from ALCs, unfortunately it is not possible as it creates other memory leaks (e.g. from the [EngineFileUtilities](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/8f208e60995dce87ecd5f0edd313b23ef1d67bb8/src/Build/Evaluation/Context/EvaluationContext.cs#L66)).\r\n",
