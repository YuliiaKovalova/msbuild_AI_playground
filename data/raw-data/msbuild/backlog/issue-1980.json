The first logged error is `ToolTask`'s generic \"the launched tool did not exit `0`\" message, which [is logged](https://travis-ci.org/AArnott/TravisCINetSDK/builds/222434420#L434):\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/travis/build/AArnott/TravisCINetSDK/lib/lib.csproj(17,5): error MSB3073: The command \"dotnet codegen\" exited with code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's nothing MSBuild can do to make this better. The task could be changed to pay attention to the message that was written to stdout, promoting it as an error. Or the CLI could emit that message to stderr, which `ToolTask` by default logs as error.\r\n\r\n",
