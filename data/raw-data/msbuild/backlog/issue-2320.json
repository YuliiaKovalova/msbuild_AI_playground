  "body": "The current output folders in the MSBuild repo are a hard-to-understand mishmash of \r\n* Binaries built in this repo\r\n* NuGet-delivered referenced binaries\r\n* Targets and props canonically in this repo\r\n* Other files from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis is confusing, especially if you are trying to take the output of this repo and plunk it into something (like VS or Mono). This is handled for VS by explicitly declaring our output in the [vsix manifest](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/07c3b3392dc05e0e3aba18bdec235a374aa72301/setup/files.swr).\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if there was a simple folder produced by the build that was _just the output of this repo_. We'll also need an **additional** folder with a usable deployment of MSBuild suitable for the second phase of our bootstrap build and our tests. But it'd be great if that was separate.",
