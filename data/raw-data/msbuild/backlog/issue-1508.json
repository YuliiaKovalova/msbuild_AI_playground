  "body": "When inspecting the MSBuild error reported in [this issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-462378), the most exhausting part was to identify which value in `TaskExecutionHost.FindTaskInRegistry` was actually `null`. \r\n\r\nIt was `TaskFactory.TaskType`, and the `.FullName`-access threw the `NullReferenceException` (see  [TaskExecutionHost.cs, line 987](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/cb8c727a898e4439a3cd18f329504e436b0b7c00/src/XMakeBuildEngine/BackEnd/TaskExecutionHost/TaskExecutionHost.cs#L987)), which crashed MSBuild with _\"error MSB1025: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild\"_.\r\n\r\nPlease add a null-check before the `.FullName`-access to improve debuggging when a `TaskFactory` behaves wrong.",
