  "body": "For NetCore MSBuild, we don't plan to support the idea of toolsets--if you need a different set of tools, use a different MSBuild package with different binaries and/or targets.\n\nThis idea should be baked into the code deeper than it currently is.  Right now, we have targeted `#if FEATURE_INSTALLED_MSBUILD` to make things compile for .NET Core.  What we should have is a (single) place where the behavior begins to differ.  At the moment I'm thinking it's in [`ToolsetReader.ReadAllToolsets`](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/7eaf6cb744bdd48e8b88b952758e604e8d9ee638/src/XMakeBuildEngine/Definition/ToolsetReader.cs#L97), which would always be guaranteed to return a single toolset for NetCore.\n",
