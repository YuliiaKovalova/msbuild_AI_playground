Create project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n\t  <OutputType>Library</OutputType>\r\n\t  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\r\n\t  <IsPackable>true</IsPackable>\r\n\t  <!-- packaging properties -->\r\n\t  <PackageVersion>1.2.3</PackageVersion>\r\n\t  <Title>Some library</Title>\r\n\t  <authors>Microsoft</authors>\r\n\t  <owners>Microsoft</owners>\r\n\t  <PackageId>SomeLib</PackageId>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Build: `dotnet pack /check /v:d /bl`\r\n3. Observe the `owners` property being flagged - which is correct:\r\n```\r\nC:\\repro\\TestProj.csproj (11,5): https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#BC0203 - Property: [owners] was declared/initialized, but it was never used.\r\n```\r\n4. Observe the `Title` property being flagged - which is false positive:\r\n```\r\nC:\\repro\\TestProj.csproj (11,5): https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#BC0203 - Property: [Title] was declared/initialized, but it was never used.\r\n```\r\n5. Check the binlog - that the property is being dereferenced:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7fa1090-c1e1-405f-998b-bc724a0c1f15)\r\n\r\n### Repro Files\r\n\r\n[Repro.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16839596/Repro.zip)\r\n",
