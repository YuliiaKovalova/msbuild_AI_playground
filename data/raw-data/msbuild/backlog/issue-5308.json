  "body": "The Exec Task currently doesn't allow specifying environment variables which would be set for the to invoked process.\r\n\r\n### Example use case\r\nThe SDK currently defines a `Run` target which is used by VS to F5 an application. The properties used in the `Run` target are `RunCommand`, `RunArguments` and `RunWorkingDirectory`: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/3ed908ee77c592bae787ac78f466c3bc0581970a/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets#L757.\r\n\r\nIf the Exec Task would allow specifying environment variables we could add a `RunEnvironmentVariables` property which would remove the need for an extra launchSettings.json file: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/817ebcaeb617813f98650e78c14e76bbd8b733b0/eng/testing/launchSettings.json#L14-L16.\r\n\r\n### Other references\r\n- http://blog.jdhardy.ca/2011/12/setting-environment-variables-for.html\r\n- https://www.develop-bugs.com/article/21515881/Use+path+system+environment+variable+in+MSBuild+exec+task\r\n\r\ncc @rainersigwald ",

We have a link in each of them pointing to the base class, but is there a way to define a central snippet that could be included in each doc page?",
