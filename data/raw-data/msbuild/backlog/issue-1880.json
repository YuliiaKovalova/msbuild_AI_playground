  "body": "I'm trying to use [PhantomJS NuGET package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PhantomJS/), but it's not possible with `PackageReference`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"PhantomJS\" Version=\"2.1.1\">\r\n      <IncludeAssets>all</IncludeAssets>\r\n</PackageReference>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does not do anything. I'd expect it to copy the files inside PhantomJS package to the output directory so I could use the binary file inside the package.\r\n\r\nI think `PackageReference` does not have support using packages such as PhantomJS which have no .NET code in it, just random files.\r\n\r\nI suggest a feature to be able to copy files from a NuGET package to output directory\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"PhantomJS\" Version=\"2.1.1\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>tools/*</CopyToOutputDirectory> <!-- new feature here -->\r\n</PackageReference>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the PhantomJS has folder called \"tools\" inside, that needs to be copied to output directory to make it usable in the app.\r\n\r\n",
