  "title": "[Performance]: Implement per-file locking in ProjectRootElementCache",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen evaluating projects in parallel, MSBuild is likely to need to load the same files at about the same time on different threads. This leads to wasted work as `ProjectRootElementCache`  doesn't prevent the same xml file from being parsed multiple times.\r\n\r\nThis code comment captures the incorrect assumption:\r\n```C#\r\n  // We do not lock loading with common _locker of the cache, to avoid lock contention.\r\n  // Decided also not to lock this section with the key specific locker to avoid the overhead and code overcomplication, as\r\n  // it is not likely that two threads would use Get function for the same project simultaneously and it is not a big deal if in some\r\n  // cases we load the same project twice.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, when evaluating projects in the picasso solution with 2-way parallelism, this issue leads to 45 files being loaded twice. Enough to trigger a Perf DDRIT regression for file I/O and allocations.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.CSharp.targets\r\nMicrosoft.CSharp.CurrentVersion.targets\r\nMicrosoft.Managed.Core.targets\r\nMicrosoft.Common.props\r\n...\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nRun evaluation on multiple threads in parallel when the `ProjectRootElementCache` is empty.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\n\r\nExample Perf DDRITs regression: [internal link](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_apps/hub/ms-vseng.pit-vsengPerf.pit-hub?baselineBuild=33514.25&baselineBranch=main&targetBuild=33514.25.laprosek.230314.161253.458070&targetBranch=main&runGroup=PerfDDRITs64&since=2023-03-14T00%3A00%3A00)\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nIt's strictly better for a thread that needs a file and lost the race to start loading it to block waiting for the winning thread than to duplicate the work of loading it.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.6.0-preview-23163-05+4ffba3fe0 for .NET Framework\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Regression Details\r\n\r\n_No response_",
