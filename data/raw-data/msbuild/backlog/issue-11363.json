  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe [Terminal Logger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/9.0/terminal-logger), which was recently made the default, underlines paths to files, making them into clickable links. Under some conditions that I have not yet been able to determine, this underlining becomes stuck, resulting in a terminal like below:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/999aa08f-84b8-4f89-b14a-6cc1f17b7c01)\n\nThis appears to be limited to Windows Terminal sessions (cmd, and git bash for sure - haven't tried in Powershell), not conhost sessions.\n\nWorkaround for now is to disable it via env var as mentioned in the link above.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nrun `dotnet build` \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUnderlines would not leak out and change the entire terminal session.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nTerminal ends up underlined.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n.NET 9.0.1022, Windows 10, Windows Terminal",
