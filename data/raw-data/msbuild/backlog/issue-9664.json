  "body": "https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6974 introduced the concept of \"immutable directories\", where files within those directories won't be checked for changes within a build, because they're expected to be static.\r\n\r\nHowever, those directories can still be _enumerated_ many times in the course of a build. That should be cached just like the contents and modifications times.",
