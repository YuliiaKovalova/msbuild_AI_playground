  "body": "Discussed offline with members of the MSBuild team: This item covers several PRs to be sent to update MSBuild code style using ReSharper. R# also finds performance-affecting cases like setting methods to static and specifying readonly on variables only set by a constructor. While using it on the codebase it also pointed out some actual code bugs that I'll open separate items for.\r\n\r\nThere are some widespread naming bugs for method parameters where a string is used for a variable name in e.g. ArgumentNullException but has drifted away from changes to the underlying variable name. Use nameof() to fix these cases and improve exception contents.\r\n\r\n",
