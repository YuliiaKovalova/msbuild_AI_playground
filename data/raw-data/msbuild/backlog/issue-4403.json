  "body": "Several settings make it possible to find references (managed assemblies and WinMDs) from machine-wide locations like the Windows directory or the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). This can lead to builds that work on one machine, where a thing is installed, and not on another.\r\n\r\nWe should have a single flag to enable only explicit locations for reference searches, so that teams can opt into the more explicable behavior.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should have a warning-wave warning when that flag is not set.",
