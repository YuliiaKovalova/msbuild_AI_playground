  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nGraphBuild doesn't pick up .wapproj packaging project from a solution\r\n\r\nMy VS solution file has several .csproj projects, one .vcxproj project and one **.wapproj** project.  When I use GraphBuild parameter to build the solution, the .csproj & .vcxproj projects are built, but the .wapproj project is not built. Looks like it is not in the graph output.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for using GraphBuild parameter is to speed up the build process. Is there a way to include .wapproj in MSBuild with GraphBuild parameter?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following as possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n\r\nIf providing steps to reproduce the issue proves difficult, consider attaching a binlog:\r\n[Details on sharing binary logs](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog)\r\n[More information on binary logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md)\r\nNOTE: Binary logs capture environment information. Ensure it does not include any information you don't want to be public before you attach one.\r\nIf you want to share one just with Microsoft, you can [report a problem through Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report) and share it privately with Microsoft.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n",
