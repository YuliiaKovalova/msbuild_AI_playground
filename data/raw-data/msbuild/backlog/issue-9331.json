  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is very straightforward (or it should be).\r\n\r\nI am trying to merge all of my DLLs and associated resources into a single executable with Visual Studio 2017 Community using ILMerge. I get the following error:\r\n\r\nError       ILMerge.Merge: ERROR!!: Duplicate type 'XamlGeneratedNamespace.GeneratedInternalTypeHelper' found in assembly 'xxxx.WPF'. Do you want to use the /allowDup option? Primary_Calc_Console_01         \r\n\r\n\r\nI see that an ILMerge.props file has been introduced after the installation. Presumably, this is a config file for ILMerge (?).\r\n\r\n```\r\nI see the following tag in the config file:\r\n    <!-- added in Version 1.0.4, default=none -->\r\n    <ILMergeAllowDuplicateType></ILMergeAllowDuplicateType>\r\n\r\n```\r\nCan someone tell me what value I should give it to allow duplicate types?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI see the following tag in the config file:\r\n```\r\n    <!-- added in Version 1.0.4, default=none -->\r\n    <ILMergeAllowDuplicateType></ILMergeAllowDuplicateType>\r\n\r\n```\r\nCan someone tell me what value I should give it to allow duplicate types?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIgnore duplicate types\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\n\r\n_No response_",
