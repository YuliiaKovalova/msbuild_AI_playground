  "body": "Currently, we try SDK resolvers based on which are resolved, and their self-defined priority order. But that means that (for example) we must load the NuGet SDK resolver even for projects that don't use it, because we can't know in advance that (for example) the .NET SDK resolver will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nWe could add a name pattern to the registration and search by longest-match first.\r\n\r\nIt could be something like\r\n\r\n* .NET SDK Resolver: `Microsoft.NET.*`\r\n* NuGet resolver: `*`\r\n\r\nThen if we're trying to resolve `Microsoft.NET.SDK` it'll match against the former and we won't even have to load the latter.\r\n\r\n(this is based on ideas from and discussion with @olgaark)",

The main change from the initial idea is that we decided to go with regex instead of wildcards. Feel free to review & discuss the decisions we have made for this change. ",
