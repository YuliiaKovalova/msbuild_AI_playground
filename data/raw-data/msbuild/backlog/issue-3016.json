  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nFrom a task call Type.GetType() passing a simple name to an assembly which has not been loaded.\r\n\r\nSee attached project.\r\n[msbuildRepro.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1746006/msbuildRepro.zip)\r\n\r\nYou can run the `net46` version of the sample using desktop msbuild and see that it succeeds:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\ericstj\\source\\msbuildRepro\\task\\bin\\Debug\\net46>msbuild /nologo /v:m\r\nlib.MyPlugin\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the `netcoreapp2.0` version of sample using dotnet msbuild and see that it fails:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\ericstj\\source\\msbuildRepro\\task\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0>dotnet msbuild /nologo /v:m\r\nC:\\Users\\ericstj\\source\\msbuildRepro\\task\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\test.csproj(6,5): error : Could not load lib.MyPlugin,lib\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nSuccessfully load the simple-named assembly.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nFails to load the simple-named assembly.\r\n\r\nThe bug is here: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/7b4c71a46611f5f03c8d5a796ef267aa8af2ae49/src/Shared/CoreCLRAssemblyLoader.cs#L126\r\n\r\nIn this case the referenced assembly name passed in will be null (since the string didn't contain a version), but the assemblyName returned by AssemblyLoadContext will have a version (since the assembly itself has a version) so this comparison will fail.  The simple fix is to change this to \r\n```\r\nif (assemblyName.Version != null && candidateAssemblyName.Version != assemblyName.Version)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was able to test a workaround by passing the assembly version to my sample (`lib.MyPlugin,lib,Version=1.0.0.0`) which is possible here in the contrived case but won't be possible for all folks.\r\n\r\nI think to match the CoreCLR loader behavior you might even want to candidate assembly versions that are higher than the referenced version, but that's another issue.\r\n\r\n/cc @erozenfeld \r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n15.4.8.50001\r\n`dotnet msbuild /version` output:\r\n15.5.153.27799\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n15.5.0-preview-007044",
