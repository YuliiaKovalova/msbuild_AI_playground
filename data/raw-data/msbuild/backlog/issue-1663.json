  "title": "Cross-Targeting \"rebuild\" doesn't cause Build target to run",
  "body": "In most projects, the Rebuild target is just\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"Rebuild\"\r\n        DependsOnTargets=\"Clean;Build\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr very similar.\r\n\r\nIn the \"outer\" build of a crosstargeting build, however, it's [defined differently](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/754c9d1da0380849dd74794b1cdc2f4a4a690f63/src/XMakeTasks/Microsoft.Common.CrossTargeting.targets#L99)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"Rebuild\" DependsOnTargets=\"_SetRebuildInnerTarget;DispatchToInnerBuilds\" />\r\n  <Target Name=\"_SetRebuildInnerTarget\">\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n      <InnerTargets>Rebuild</InnerTargets>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n  </Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis forwards the \"rebuild\" command to each of the inner builds. That works fine, but it means that it's hard for a build extension to hook onto the outer build, because it's not guaranteed that the `Build` target will run. That caused problems like https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4475, where an `AfterTargets=\"Build\"` was (confusingly) not firing on rebuild.",
