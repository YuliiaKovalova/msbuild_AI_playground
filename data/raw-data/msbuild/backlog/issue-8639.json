  "body": "### Issue Description\n\n@KirillOsenkov was looking at an internal build failure that was hard to diagnose, in part because the Resolving SDK events aren't parented under any particular project evaluation\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7988 should show these symptoms too.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf SDK resolution fails, all of the messages should be attributed to a project, so it's easier to understand what was looking for the SDK and any progress messages/warnings associated with it.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3347530/230182968-168b8d6b-c64a-42d1-9615-ecfb0f7f0425.png)\n\n### Analysis\n\nThis may be caused by the desire to single-instance SDK resolution for a build, so the actual resolution is happening in one thread while other things wait on it.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
