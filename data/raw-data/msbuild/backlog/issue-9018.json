Ended up just stealing the code from [msbuild that does it](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Utilities/ToolTask.cs#L1259). This is essentially how our entire build tool stack works today so it seems like a good source to draw some. \r\n>\r\n> Would be nice to have an API for `FindOnPath` but that seems unlikely. Also I'd still have to polyfill that for downlevel targets. \r\n>\r\n> @rainersigwald, @baronfel: have you all ever considered exposing a `FindToolPath` on `ToolTask` or MSBuild APIs in general that we could use to find `dotnet`? That way the logic for parsing `$PATH` is centralized.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @jaredpar in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/88754#issuecomment-1633029934_\r\n            ",
