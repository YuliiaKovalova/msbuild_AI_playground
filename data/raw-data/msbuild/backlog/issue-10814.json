  "title": "Unable to disable msbuild tlog generation",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI was under the impression that tolog files can be disabled by adding \n\n```\n<PropertyGroup Label=\"Globals\">\n    <TrackFileAccess>false</TrackFileAccess>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\nto my `vcxproj` file.  I have been unable to get this to work.\n\n[myproject.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17370307/myproject.zip)\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\ncreate hello world: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-using-msbuild-to-create-a-visual-cpp-project?view=msvc-170\n\nAdd \n\n```\n<PropertyGroup Label=\"Globals\">\n    <TrackFileAccess>false</TrackFileAccess>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\nto myproject.vcxproj.  Then run\n\n```\nmsbuild .\\myproject.vcxproj /p:configuration=debug \n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nno `debug\\myproject.tlog\\*.tlog` files are created\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nmany tlog files are generated in the `debug` folder\n\n### Analysis\n\nvery limited support docs exist\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n```\nmsbuild --version                                                                                                    \nMSBuild version 17.11.9+a69bbaaf5 for .NET Framework                                                                    \n17.11.9.46202\n```",

Surely it would be more efficient to not generate them in the first place.",
