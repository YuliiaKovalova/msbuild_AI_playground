  "body": "### Summary\n\nMy computer is unfortunately pretty slow, so I get some long builds. Here's the latest example of an incremental build of the dotnet/sdk repo:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5e48cbd-f7ac-4448-8716-b6d1f4b7fd48)\r\n\r\nWhat would you think of having a breakpoint after which, instead of showing just seconds, we show minutes and seconds (`Build succeeded in 19 minutes and 29 seconds`) and a later breakpoint for hours (`Build succeeded in 5 hours 7 minutes and 15 seconds`). Would folks be in favor of something like that? If so, what do you think would be appropriate breakpoints? I was thinking like 200 seconds --> 3 minutes and 20 seconds and 100 minutes --> 1 hour and 40 minutes, but I just made that up based on what felt right to me. 60 seconds --> 1 minute and 60 minutes --> 1 hour might be better.\r\n\r\nAnd if you like this idea, I can try to work on it at some point. I recognize that it's not particularly urgent.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nI want to know how long my builds took without doing math.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nBuilds that do the math for me!\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
