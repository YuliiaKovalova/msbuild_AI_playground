  "title": "[Bug]: Generate MSBuild binlog files repeatedly when  project and solution in the same directory",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\n Set the environment variable MSBuildDebugEngine to 1 and use the default MSBuild_Logs directory under the current working directory. Create a project which solution and project in the same directory with Visual studio.  It will generate the msbuild logs repeatedly until exclude the MSBuild_Logs folder from the project.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. MSBuildDebugEngine to 1 and don't set the MSBUILDDEBUGPATH\r\n2. Download the project or create a project which solution and project in the same directory with Visual studio \r\n[ClassLibrary1.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/12026336/ClassLibrary1.zip)\r\n3. Reopen the solution and build.\r\n4. The design time files will generate repeatedly\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe design time files shouldn't generate without code changes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe design time files will generate repeatedly\r\n[CentralNode_devenv_PID=30592_x64_BuildManager_DesignTimeBatchBuild.binlog.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/12026414/CentralNode_devenv_PID.30592_x64_BuildManager_DesignTimeBatchBuild.binlog.txt)\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe issue is since the MSBuild_Logs folder is included when start to build. We need to exclude the MSBuild_Logs folder\r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n    <Compile Remove=\"MSBuild_Logs\\**\" />\r\n    <EmbeddedResource Remove=\"MSBuild_Logs\\**\" />\r\n    <None Remove=\"MSBuild_Logs\\**\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
