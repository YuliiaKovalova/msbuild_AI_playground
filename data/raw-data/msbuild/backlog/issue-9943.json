  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen building project and passing the not valid property name from command line, the build does not report the error.\r\nExample of the invocation: \r\ndotnet msbuild .\\projectfile.csproj /p:\"property name\"=\"property value\"\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe error to be reported 100% of the time.\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB4177: Invalid property. The name \"property name\" contains an invalid character \" \".\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nSome versions do not report the error. \r\nI was not able to repro it via latest main branch. \r\n\r\nTodo: \r\n\r\n- Understand the reason why the error not reporting in 17.9.x\r\n- Check if it is fixed in latest main \r\n- Add tests to the scenario ",
