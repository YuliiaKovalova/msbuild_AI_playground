  "body": "I don't have a self-contained repro for this, but am happy to work with anyone  that investigates this to get to the bottom of the issue.\r\n\r\nWe recently turned on verbose console logging in CLI. This had the desired effect on all build flavors except x86 Windows where we started seeing OutOfMemory exceptions. Turning the verbosity back down to `normal` eliminated the exception. \r\n\r\nThe build step in question is quite contained. There are 37 lines of verbose output at the time that the OOM occurs. Here is the relevant output:\r\n```\r\n2016-12-16T12:11:06.4902191Z                    Set Property: SdkInstallerNupkgFile=D:\\DOTNET-CLI-W004\\_work\\4\\s\\/artifacts/win10-x86/packages/VS.Redist.Common.Net.Core.SDK.x86.1.0.0-preview5-004262.nupkg\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z MSBUILD : error MSB1025: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild.\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z System.OutOfMemoryException: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z    at Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager.EndBuild()\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z    at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.BuildProject(String projectFile, String[] targets, String toolsVersion, Dictionary`2 globalProperties, ILogger[] loggers, LoggerVerbosity verbosity, DistributedLoggerRecord[] distributedLoggerRecords, Int32 cpuCount, Boolean enableNodeReuse, TextWriter preprocessWriter, Boolean debugger, Boolean detailedSummary)\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z MSBUILD : error MSB1025: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild.\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z System.OutOfMemoryException: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z    at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.BuildProject(String projectFile, String[] targets, String toolsVersion, Dictionary`2 globalProperties, ILogger[] loggers, LoggerVerbosity verbosity, DistributedLoggerRecord[] distributedLoggerRecords, Int32 cpuCount, Boolean enableNodeReuse, TextWriter preprocessWriter, Boolean debugger, Boolean detailedSummary)\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z    at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.Execute(String[] commandLine)\r\n2016-12-16T12:13:15.3666181Z Unhandled Exception: OutOfMemoryException.\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jeffkl",
