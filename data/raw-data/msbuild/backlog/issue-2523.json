  "body": "HI! I have some troubles when trying to build project on TFS server. Our main solution has some dependencies resolved as Nuget packages. When first solution builded in TFS some projects are packed to Nuget Packages and published in feed - this works fine. Packages really created and showed in Nuget  package manager and may used in Visual Studio without problems. But not TFS. I added PreBuildEvent to some projects in solution that builds later, like this\r\n``  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"$(TF_BUILD)==true\">\r\n    <PreBuildEvent>\r\n      \"\\\\out-oracle\\nuget\\nuget\" update $(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\packages.config -id Sbt.CMS.Cashflow.Infrastructure -Source \\\\out-oracle\\nuget -Version 1.0.$(BUILD_BUILDID)\r\n      \"\\\\out-oracle\\nuget\\nuget\" update $(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\packages.config -id Sbt.CMS.Infrastructure -Source \\\\out-oracle\\nuget -Version 1.0.$(BUILD_BUILDID)\r\n    </PreBuildEvent>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>``\r\n\r\nIn build proccess i show that package really updated and replaced commited version of nuget like 2017.xx.xx to server builded version of package with number 1.0.0.xxxx\r\nBut really it does not used. MSBuild used old version of dll from first version of package. \r\nI have no idea why it happened, maybe cache?\r\nYou may show it attached screenshot\r\n![build screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15110338/30419529-5cb5430c-993f-11e7-9aca-dbe3c9683538.png)\r\nAdditinally I attached build log of this solution. Look closely to Sbt.Cashflow.Server.Core.\r\n[buildlogCashflowServerCore.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1302321/buildlogCashflowServerCore.txt)\r\n\r\np.s. I found article [http://netitude.bc3tech.net/2014/11/28/auto-update-your-nuget-packages-at-build-time/](url) that says \r\n\r\n> But it\u2019s not as simple as putting \u2018nuget update <package id>\u2019 in the pre-build steps. In fact that\u2019s actually too late. ",
