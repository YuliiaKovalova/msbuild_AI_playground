  "body": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use `CanonicalError.cs` to output custom warning messages to the Error List window for a build tool I'm creating. The function is great, I can see my warnings in the window and double click to be taken right to them, the only thing that isn't showing is the error codes I have for my warnings.\r\n\r\nHere's a [repro repository](https://github.com/murray-coueslant/MSBuildErrorCodeRepro) that exhibits the same behaviour, it shows a mimicked version of the object I use to build my messages as well as the exact code used to build them. You might need to change the path in `AppUsingBuildTool.csproj` in order to make it work, I wasn't too sure how to convert the path into a relative one so I've left it as an absolute as it is on my machine.\r\n\r\nFor a very brief period of time the warning messages did show the codes, and curiously every warning also showed its column to be 1 whilst the error codes were showing. Since then the codes and columns have not appeared again.\r\n\r\nThis is how I am calling the tool in my .csproj file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"AfterBuild\">\r\n    <Exec Command=\"C:\\Users\\murray.coueslant\\Documents\\dev\\MarkdownUtility\\MarkdownUtility\\bin\\Debug\\MarkdownUtility.exe lint -p docs -r\" />\r\n  </Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that the format of the messages have to be very specific, however I have checked the Regexes in `CanonicalError.cs` against my output using [Regex Storm](regexstorm.net), and they seem to match fine. I can even see the code being shown in the `CODE` named group stemming from the following line in `CanonicalError.cs` when I test the pattern against the messages I create,\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Match anything starting with a space that's not a colon/space, followed by a colon.\r\n// Error code is optional in which case \"error\"/\"warning\" can be followed immediately by a colon.\r\n + @\"( \\s*(?<CODE>[^: ]*))?\\s*:\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is how I construct my error message, using data from another class inside the tool itself\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nConsole.Out.WriteLine($\"{file}({ruleTrigger.LineNumber}, {ruleTrigger.ColumnNumber}): test warning {ruleCode}: {ruleTrigger.RuleDescription} {ruleTrigger.RuleNotes}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nand here's what the build output in Visual Studio shows when the tool is run as an after build event in another project,\r\n\r\n```output\r\n1>C:\\Users\\murray.coueslant\\Documents\\dev\\BuildToolTest\\BuildToolTest\\docs\\docs\\07 Procedures\\05 IT\\04 Firewall.md(24, 1) : test warning MD040: Code fence has no language specified. Code fence on line 24 has no language specified. Correct by specifying a language right after the first set of delimiters.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using Visual Studio 2017, and have MSBuild version 15.1.0.0.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better place that I should have asked this question, please let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
