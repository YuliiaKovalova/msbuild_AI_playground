  "body": "One of our goal is to separate the bitness of MSBuild from the compiler/link/etc tools.  One issue came up when looking for TLBREF.dll used by midl.exe.  64bit MIDL couldn\u2019t find the 64bit tlbref.dll because Framework64 wasn\u2019t in the path because it isn't available on 32bit MSBuild.\n\nMSBuildFrameworkToolsPath32 \u2013 always 32bit Framework\nMSBuildFrameworkToolsPath \u2013 depends on msbuild bitness.\n\nProposal: To add $(MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath64) on 32bit MSBuild to point to Framework64==\"C:\\windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\".\n",
