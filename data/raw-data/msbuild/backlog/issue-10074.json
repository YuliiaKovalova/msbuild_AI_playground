  "body": "### Context\n\nCurrently the BuildCheckLoggerConnector relies on pre-existing build events forwarding functionality. This works since `CentralForwardingLogger` is being used for unrecognized loggers - which forwards all the events, plus sets the `MinimumRequiredMessageImportance` to Low (on additional msbuild nodes)\n\nIt however might lead to over-excessive emiting and trnsmission of events, which might have negative impact on perf.\n\n### Need to investigate\n\n* What is the perf impact of using the `CentralForwardingLogger` vs the `ConfigurableForwardingLogger` with couple basic events - as is being requested by the console log or terminal logger (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/47ba51c0d0b100c690c91ebdb1ccca18831e4ea6/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L3796-L3801)\n* Can we use `ConfigurableForwardingLogger` with enabling the all events (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/Logging/DistributedLoggers/ConfigurableForwardingLogger.cs#L402-L423) \n+ setting `MinimumRequiredMessageImportance` to High (in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/47ba51c0d0b100c690c91ebdb1ccca18831e4ea6/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Logging/LoggingService.cs#L1752) as a stop gap - that will ensure all events are transfered, while MessageImportance.Low messages are not emitted nor transfered from the Tasks\n* Can we influence the forwarding even during the build? Currently those seem to be set prior the build starts. But we'll discover the opt-ins, configurations and custom analyzers only during the evaluation of individual projects\n\n### References\n\n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/creating-forwarding-loggers?view=vs-2022",
