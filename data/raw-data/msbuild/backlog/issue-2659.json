Here msbuild carries version 15.5.113.63837.\r\n\r\nI already spotted the following blog:\r\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/heaths/2017/09/18/installing-build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017-in-a-docker-container/\r\n\r\nWhich looks promising. Only now I need to know the magic string for this particular preview build of the vs_buildtools.exe executable.",
