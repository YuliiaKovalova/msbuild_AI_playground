  "title": "T4 TextTemplating stopped working recently",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nFirst of all sorry if this is not the correct repository to report the bug, I was not able to find a better repository.\r\nI don't know when the problem started happening but I believe it would have been after 5 months ago because that is the last time I did an update for https://github.com/innovoft/Innovoft.IO.SplitReaders https://www.nuget.org/packages/Innovoft.IO.SplitReaders . But at some point the T4 import stopped generating files. I only noticed because I started a new project that I need to follow the same basic setup, and it didn't work. I deleted the *.tt.cs files in Innovoft.IO.SplitReaders and the test project no longer worked, so the problem could be older than 5 months.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1) download https://github.com/innovoft/Innovoft.IO.SplitReaders\r\n2) build test (only building the library works because otherwise nothing is calling one of the generated methods such as ReadColumnsAdd)\r\n\r\nHere is the sections from the csproj file related to T4 that has worked in the past. I don't know how to quote xml.\r\nPropertyGroup\r\nTransformOnBuild: true\r\nOverwriteReadOnlyOutputFiles: true\r\nTransformOutOfDateOnly: false\r\n\r\nImport Project=\"$(VSToolsPath)\\TextTemplating\\Microsoft.TextTemplating.targets\"\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nT4 create *.tt.cs files that will compiled\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nAs far as I can tell nothing is happening with the T4s.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nI think something changed with the T4 system.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET Framework\r\n17.4.0.51802\r\nWindows 10 Pro x64\r\n",
