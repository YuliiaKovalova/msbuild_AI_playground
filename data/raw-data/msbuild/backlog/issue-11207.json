  "body": "Most of tasks MSBuild uses are not intrinsic - e.g. they need to be located and loaded into the assembly. This loading has a visible runtime impact:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60c28937-6247-4232-8e5f-12d5cf85b24c)\nThis is happening first time any task is loaded to be executed - afterward it is cached.\n\nWe could pre-heat the cache as soon as we first encounter the task name (e.g. during XML parsing). This could allow for a neat parallelization use case that should be contained enough so as not to cause issues elsewhere.\n\n",
