  "title": "Proposal: DownloadFile task",
  "body": "Problem statement:\r\n\r\nThe mechanics require to accomplish:\r\n\r\n* Download a file before build\r\n* Include as Content, Compiler or None in the build / package\r\n\r\nare quite cumbersome. Some folks accomplish this by downloading the content before invoking msbuild (isolated mode). Others use `<Exec>` and utilities like Invoke-WebRequest or curl-wget etc. Then there are people like me who are using [Roslyn]CodeTaskFactory and HttpClient in UsingTask to avoid the cross-platform disparities. But then reevaluation of package/compile targets makes it harder if you want to include the file in the build.\r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\n\r\nIf we could get a decent download task that takes some basic parameters like URL, Destination, Credentials and use HttpClient behind the scenes from msbuild, that will mitigate the pain.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<DownloadFile\r\n  TaskName=\"DownloadMySourceFile\"\r\n  Url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreburto/FtpThing/d0e133c/FtpThing/RemoteFile.vb\"\r\n  Destination=\"$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\SharedDTOs\\RemoteFile.vb\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nPart 2 is moved to #3220\r\n\r\nIf you think it is common enough to be considered out of the box, please share your thoughts.",
