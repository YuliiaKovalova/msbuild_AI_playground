This is useful when your project\r\n                     tree requires packages to be restored before they\r\n                     can be built. Specifying /restore is the same as\r\n                     specifying /restore:True.  Use the parameter to\r\n                     override a value that comes from a response file.\r\n                     (Short form: /r)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis help text doesn't make it clear that `/r` with a `Restore` target should be used over constructs like `DependsOnTargets=\"Restore\"`.\r\n\r\nPlease find a few words that make users use this switch instead. It doesn't have to go into details of the cache mechanisms, just something like:\r\n`Use this switch to ensure the build uses the output generated by the Restore target`",
