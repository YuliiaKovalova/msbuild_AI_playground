  "title": "[Performance]: ProjectGraphNode ProjectType calculation should only happen once",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nTo keep the project data and project interpretation separate in Project Graph, an enum representing the project type only lives in the interpretation side of things.  However, this value is used in four places during Project Graph loading:\n\nhttps://github.com/search?q=repo%3Adotnet%2Fmsbuild%20getprojecttype&type=code\n\nInstead, this calculation should be performed once while leaving the implementation internal so its not exposed publicly.  When profiling project loading, I saw this calculation happening several thousand times for large project trees.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nLoad Project Graph for a large project tree and see this calculation happen several times per project instance.\n\n### Data\n\nProfiling showed this calculation happening four times per project instance.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_\n\n### Regression\n\n- [ ] yes\n- [x] no\n\n### Regression Details\n\n_No response_",
