I had a mix of projects being published at once (even though they are independent from one another other than some shared dependencies), some used AspNetCore.All version 2.0.5 and some used version 2.0.6. This worked fine on my machine, publishing one after another, but on VSTS it got the above error. It would appear it's maintaining a reference to the newer DLL, rather than loading in the correct one for 2.0.5\r\n\r\nEdit: I should add, updating all projects to use 2.0.6 resolved the issue for me.",
