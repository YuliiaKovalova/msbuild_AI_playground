  "title": "Optimize GetItemProvenance for a large number of calls",
  "body": "There are cases of large projects where GetItemProvenance (GIP) is called ~40k times per file system change. Since GIP creates regexes for all the globs for each call, it gets quite expensive since the regexes keep getting recreated.\r\n\r\nWe should look into relieving this. Here are some options:\r\n- cache the regular expressions. Since the lifecycle of the Project object is much larger than the burst of GIP calls, and since memory pressure is a problem in VS, it may be worth handing over ownership of the GIP cache lifecycle to the caller.\r\n- create a batched overload, so callers can pass in 40k strings at once.",
