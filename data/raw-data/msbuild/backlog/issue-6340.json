  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nIf AppLocker is active on the system you are using and you try to run a post build event in Visual Studio, e.g. to sign the binary you are developing to be accepted by AppLocker, MSBUILD creates a batch file in %TEMP% with the contents of the post build event. The execution of this batch file is in response then blocked by AppLocker.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Enable AppLocker on the machine used for developing\r\n- Run Visual Studio with a normal user account (WITHOUT administrative rights)\r\n- Configure a directory where your projects can be run without restrictions\r\n- Create one of the aforementioned projects in that directory\r\n- Add a post build event to that project\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe project builds and runs without issue.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe projects builds, but the post build event fails.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nhttps://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Build-events-create-batch-files-in-temp/1339881#T-N1387549-N1391588\r\n\r\nComment from Benjamin Villalobos [MSFT]:\r\nAs I suspected, the inherent problem here is that MSBuild creates a batch file to run commands via exec, and that batch file is created in temp. If changing %TEMP% or relaxing applocker aren\u2019t options, your best bet is to file an issue with MSBuild or to create a custom task that will take your script and create a process directly out of it.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nWindows 10 2004 (Build 19041.804)\r\nVisual Studio 2019 16.9.3\r\n\r\nMSBUILD:\r\nMicrosoft (R)-Build-Engine, Version 16.9.0+5e4b48a27 f\u00fcr .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

        "body": "Thanks for filing the issue in our repo!\r\n\r\nExec creates the batch file and runs it because of DOS semantics. Is there a particular reason you can't change your %TEMP% environment variable to something like your project's `obj/` folder? Maybe have a script you run before/after you launch VS?",

        "body": "I think this can only be a temporary solution until VisualStudio and MSBUILD let you configure where those batch files are written and executed.\r\n\r\nRunning VisualStudio from a batch file defeats the whole windows integration. For example you get no jumplists. If you want to load specific projects, you have to create shortcuts for each project.\r\n\r\nSo imho and as AppLocker and VisualStudio/MSBUILD are Microsoft products, there has to be a better solution.",
