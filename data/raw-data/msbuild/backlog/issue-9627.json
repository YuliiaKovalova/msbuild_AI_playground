Optionally allows passing through unstructured custom key-value configurations for the rules\r\n - [ ] #9629 - Handles opt-in monitoring of overhead added byt the analyzers infra and individual analyzers\r\n - [x] #9633\r\n - [ ] #9631 - indirection and abstraction layer between the actual data from MSBuild and their consumption in analyzers\r\n - [ ] #9632 - responsible for consuming the configuration and loaded modules running the registrations, pumping underlying data to analyzers and wrapping and routing the results\r\n - [ ] #9630 - identification and implementation\r\n - [x] #9723\r\n - [x] #9729\r\n\r\nOther work:\r\n - [x] #9734\r\n - [x] #9747\r\n - [x] Detect current msbuild file and have it as part of analysis context - when asking for configuration (plus contexts might need to be preserved and switched)\r\n - [ ] Detect the root of the build - for analyzers that are checking references outside of the root of the build (https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/373/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=55808682)\r\n - [x] #9760\r\n - [ ] Canonicalize paths on Mac so analyzers can compare them ([this](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/90bc89cd0a4dcc6fd2b609eea08fee3191e97652/src/Analyzers.UnitTests/EndToEndTests.cs#L114-L117) is the workaround for now) (https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/373/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=55702688)",
