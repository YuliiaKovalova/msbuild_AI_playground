  "body": "See https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/567#issuecomment-213618851. If you don't have a recent OpenSSL installed, `init-tools.sh` fails. That's its own issue, but if you then install OpenSSL and rerun `cibuild.sh`, it fails with an error about not being able to find `corerun`. This is probably because the \"up-to-date check\" parts of init-tools are slightly broken.\n\ncc: @Sarabeth-Jaffe-Microsoft\n",
