  "body": "`Update` item operations provide a way to select items and set metadata on them.\r\n\r\nWhen another item is used as selection (e.g. `<Foo Update=\"@(Bar) Metadata=\"Value\">`), MSBuild compares all items from the operation item type (Foo) with all items from the referenced item type (Bar) and updates the intersection. This results in N^2 runtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the operation item type is the same as the referenced item type (e.g. `<Foo Update=\"@(Foo) Metadata=\"Value\">`) MSBuild could optimize and iterate over the items only once.\r\n\r\nSuggested by @dsplaisted who found this is slow when there are many items in a self referencing update: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2238#issuecomment-315937074\r\n\r\nOptimizations:\r\n- [x] self referencing Updates can short circuit matching altogether\r\n- [x] extend the optimization in Update to all item operations that use matching (for now only Remove)\r\n- [ ] add a lookup dictionary to ItemExpressionFragment such that operations that need to do matching hit the lookup instead of looping through all the ItemExpressionFragment items",

That way you wouldn't get n^2 runtime in situations where you have two different lists with a lot of items, such as `<A Update=\"@(B)\" />`.",
