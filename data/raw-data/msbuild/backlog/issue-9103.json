  "title": "[Bug]: Solution-based graph builds double-build when given a project configuration with mismatched casing",
  "body": "When building a sln with `/p:platform=X64`, non-graph builds will normalize the platform to what's defined in the solution, eg \"x64\" (lower-case). Graph builds appear not to, leading to a double build:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/6445614/948730d1-1cb5-4a8f-9f33-760ce877c000)\r\n\r\nOn of them is from the entrypoint (`/p:platform=X64`) and the other is from the p2p (`/p:Platform=x64`).\r\n\r\nMinimal repro: [SlnGraphBug.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/12262052/SlnGraphBug.zip)\r\n\r\nRepro command: `msbuild /bl /p:platform=X64 /graph`\r\nCompare with the behavior of `msbuild /bl /p:platform=X64` (non-graph) and `msbuild /bl /p:Platform=x64 /graph` (matching case)\r\n\r\nNote: using this issue for tracking. I am planning on fixing it myself.",
