  "body": "I was debugging using the magic `MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE` for https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/62314 when I noticed that task inputs weren't in the resultant binlog.\r\n\r\nThe binary logger sets some internal environment variables to make sure it logs _everything_, but only when attached through \"the usual ways\", and they don't all get triggered via `MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE` but they should.\r\n\r\nThe only one I know of for sure is `MSBUILDLOGTASKINPUTS` but we should check for others.",
