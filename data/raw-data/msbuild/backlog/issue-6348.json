  "body": "Caused by https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6141\r\n\r\nBeing on a version this old (`2.1.0-prerelease-02404-02`) will eventually break us. By default, with an assembly like this that doesn't change much I'm thinking we pick the version that came before the major version incremented last. So, `5.0.0-beta.21160.3`\r\n\r\n\r\nSide note: I chuckled at the thought of creating an \"Impending Doom\" label and attaching it to this issue.",
