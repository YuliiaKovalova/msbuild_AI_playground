The processes will last _at least_ until the end of the build in all cases.\r\n\r\nIf node reuse is enabled (it is enabled by default), worker nodes will outlive the build that created them, and may be reused for subsequent builds. There is no guarantee that the subsequent build is of the same or similar projects, and there is no guarantee that a subsequent build of the same projects will assign a particular project to the same node it used before.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to define a [task that gets its own AppDomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.build.utilities.appdomainisolatedtask), which complicates the statics situation.",
