  "title": "[Feature Request]: MSBuild Server Identifier",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nServer reuse across clones, can lead to issues when Shutdown, leading to errors.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen having multiple Clones of the same repository using MSBuild Server for speeding up compilation, we end up in situations where the MSBuild Server gets shutdown from the other clone, while a compilation is ongoing, resulting in errors because of Server Shutdown.\r\n\r\nOur setup:\r\n- Each clone have its own copy of MSBuild copied into it, and execute MSBuild Server.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nAdd an Identifier to the started server + nodes started by the server, so repositories can't interfere with each other.\r\nIt would be optimal if:\r\n- The Identifier could be passed as an argument or a new env var `SharedId`\r\n- The Identifier would be additive to the current `CommunicationsUtilities.GetHandshakeOptions` so it would work as today if no extra identifier was added.\r\n- Add the public api to `MSBuildClient` to support MSBuild Server Identifier.\r\n- Possible to use the same `SharedId` to pass to Roslyn's similar concept `SharedCompilationId`\r\n\r\nThis would make it easier to control multiple msbuild servers that can't interfere with eachother.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nThe MSBuild Server is identified with the location, so if we have two copies of MSBuild, each would have a unique identity and MSBuild Server + Nodes.",
