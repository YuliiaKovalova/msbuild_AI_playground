  "body": "I am not sure if this is a nuget issue or a msbuild issue.  When I build a solution in Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 - all nuget packages are restored 100% correctly and the solution builds.  When I try to build via MSbuild, no packages are restored at all regardless of how I configure my build scripts.\n\nNote: I am now looking into using the nuget.exe command line tool to force a restore, however that also is having issues as it is not restoring specific framework packages (like Microsoft.CSharp).\n",

On the command line you must use `nuget.exe` explicitly.\n\nThere's some documentation about this from NuGet: http://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore#package-restore-approaches\n",
