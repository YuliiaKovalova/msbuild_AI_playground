This adds to the time it takes to debug the build.\n\nTo make debugging easier, MSBuild should emit a warning: \"You are referencing the item foo as a property\".\n",

(Can be enabled through setting MSBUILDWARNONUNINITIALIZEDPROPERTY=1 or BuildParameters.WarnOnUninitializedProperty = true)\n\nHowever, when we introduced this feature back in (IIRC) VS 2010, we quickly discovered that all existing targets files used that pattern so frequently (usually when setting up defaults for commonly known properties) that it was, essentially, useless. \n\nSo I'd suggest that this also only be available under a flag, at least at first -- I wouldn't be surprised if the existing targets also used this pattern intentionally at times.   \n",
