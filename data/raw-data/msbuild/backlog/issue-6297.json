  "body": "We would like to implement and perform stress tests for the RAR task in order to identify possible issues with concurrency. This issue is part of the RAR as a service user story: #3139.\r\n\r\nIn this issue, we would like to write a test tool that would be able to:\r\n - run the RAR task using the input data set in different number of threads \r\n - validate the output against the expected state from the data set. \r\n\r\nWe suggest the test tool should be able to run the RAR task in 1 thread (baseline), 2 threads, # CPUs, and 2* # CPUs threads.",
