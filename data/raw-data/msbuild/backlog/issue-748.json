  "title": "Enhance OM: Global Exclude via ItemDefinitionGroup",
  "body": "Parent issue: #700\n\nGoal: Enable a way to specify a global exclude pattern to be applied to all items of a certain type. The alternative is to define a Property containing the global exclude patern and then append it to all the excludes of all the tags of a certain item type.\n\nDesign so far:\n\n``` xml\n<ItemDefinitionGroup>\n   <Compile Exclude=\"bin\\**\\*.*;obj\\**\\*.*\">\n</ItemDefinitionGroup>\n```\n\nBehaviour for the definition group exclude attribute:\n- When multiple ItemDefinitionGroups for the same item type have excludes\n  - latest wins. If it is additive, the user cannot overwrite it.\n- What can be referenced from the exclude:\n  - properties\n  - metadata from ItemDefinitionGroup items of this type\n- When an ItemGroup item has its own exclude\n  - union the local exclude with the global exclude\n\nBuild script pitfalls:\n- With this implementation, Compile won't ever be able to refer to something in Obj. `CoreCompile & friends` need to grab generated code from Obj via a different `TransientCompile` item\n",

        "body": "Two things to think about, I think:\n\nCan we scope this to just wildcards? If we use the word `Exclude` that would be confusing.\n\nCould an individual item's Exclude _override_ the definition exclude? Then you could do something like\n\n``` XML\n<Compile Include=\"obj\\some\\generated.cs\" Exclude=\"\" />\n```\n\n(with an empty attribute), and sidestep some of the other issues.\n\nI really don't like the idea of adding things to different items depending only on what path they're under (and that only if {magic from prior imports} applies).\n",
