  "body": "I have an ItemGroup with files that need to be processed in a Target.\r\nThis processing takes several steps and I would like to store the progress along the way (e.g. for error reporting or further processing)\r\n\r\nI find that I would like the Output keyword (for ItemName) to behave differently that it currently does.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```xml\r\n        <ItemGroup>\r\n              <SomeFile include=\"file1\">\r\n                   <Location>..\\someplace\\file1/Location>\r\n               </SomeFile>\r\n        </ItemGroup>\r\n..\r\n        <GetFileHash Files=\"%(SomeFile.Location)\">\r\n            <Output TaskParameter=\"Hash\" PropertyName=\"SomeFile\"/>\r\n        </GetFileHash>\r\n\r\n<!-- would like to have result-->\r\n        <ItemGroup>\r\n              <SomeFile include=\"file1\">\r\n                   <Location>..\\someplace\\file1/Location>\r\n                   <Hash>abcdefhash</Hash>\r\n               </SomeFile>\r\n        </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual result is that new items are appended to the ItemGroup with identity set to the Hash Value.\r\n\r\nIs there a different way to get a similar result?\r\n(e.g. if I can merge 2 ItemGroups (same length) without needing to have same identity)",

A list of items where the include is the metadata to add (hashes in this case)\r\n1. The name of the metadata to put that into\r\n\r\nAnd emits the result as a new item which can be swapped back into the old item.",
