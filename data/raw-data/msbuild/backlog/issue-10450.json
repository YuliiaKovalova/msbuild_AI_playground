I think the PackageVersion item should be moved out of this file, to prevent it from being packaged with the analyzer and affecting NuGet package restore in projects that reference the analyzer.  Perhaps to Directory.Packages.props.\n\nNoticed when looking at <https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10449>.",
