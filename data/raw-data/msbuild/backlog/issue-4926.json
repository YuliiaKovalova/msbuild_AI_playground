Events such as \"ProjectImported\" are reported under a specific evaluation.\r\n\r\nWhen a project starts building, I don't see a correlation between this project and its evaluation. I'd like to see which evaluation id was used to build this project.\r\n\r\nThis is needed to display an accurate \"preprocess\" view of a project, to only include the actual project imported events that were used in the evaluation for this project.\r\n\r\nProbably just log a message at the beginning of a project build \"Evaluation id being used: 42\"",
