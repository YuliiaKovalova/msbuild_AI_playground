        "body": "Please don't; it shouldn't matter.\n\nThe only way it would matter is if you setup your system to directly execute PE binaries. This, however, is _stupid_, because there are _lots_ of PE handlers (Wine, mono, CoreCLR), and (at least on Linux) you can't have more than one handler for a given file type.\n\nMeaning `MSBuild.exe` from a shell _won't work anyway_. Meaning the casing is _moot_; it's irrelevant.\n\nFor non-Windows support, you really want to use a [shell script](http://www.mono-project.com/archived/guiderunning_mono_applications/#shell-scripts), which you can then case however you want, and skip the extension for good measure, e.g. name the script `msbuild`.\n",

        "body": "@jonpryor I know and fully agree with that, that wasn't my point though (should've been clearer in my first post).\n\nI'm seeing lots of code like [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/XMakeCommandLine/UnitTests/XMake_Tests.cs#L593-L594) that relies on the casing of the exe for finding stuff. People do weird things all the time and given the new xplat focus I thought it'd make life easier for everyone if we standardized on all-lowercase exe/config names (or you end up with bugs like in NuGet3 where they now look for NuGet.config instead of NuGet.Config which breaks Linux, something they're hopefully fixing soon).\n\nI don't feel strongly about this at all, just wanted to hear the MSBuild team's opinion on this :smile: \n",
