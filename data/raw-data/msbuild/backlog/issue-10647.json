  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nBuildCheck doesn't have similar mechanism like `#pragma warning disable` for silencing the Roslyn analyzers.\r\nThis was decided to be out of scope for the V1 (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/BuildCheck/BuildCheck.md#out-of-scope).\r\nWith the limiting of the number of reports per Check (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10625) - users might get to a situation where they are unable to ignore unwanted diagnostics and see others.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\n* The reports throtling should be opt-out able (via Trait?)\r\n* In case of throttling, one can enable the rule in project per project - to prevent the throttling accross entire build\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThis will need a design of how the suppressions will be performed and recognized (e.g. xml comments)",
