  "body": "Our [VSIX manifest](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/setup/files.swr) doesn't list `Microsoft.Common.props`, and Visual Studio \"15\" Preview 4 shipped with an old copy (listed in a different VSIX). That means that Preview 4 doesn't have the `Directory.Build.props` behavior, even though it does work for `.targets`.\n",
