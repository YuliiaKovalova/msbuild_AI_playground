  "body": "I'm attempting to upgrade Roslyn to a new version of MSBuild:\r\n\r\n- old: 15.1.0-preview-000370-00\r\n- new: 15.1.0-preview-000458-02\r\n\r\nBetween these two versions it appears there was a change to `$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)` on Linux.  Previously when the MSBuild NuGet packages were laid out on disk post publish and run under coreclr the property would have the value `<path-to-publish>/Extensions`.  In the new packages though the property is simply `<path-to-publish>`.\r\n\r\nIs this a deliberate change from MSBuild?  \r\n\r\nRelevant changes demonstrating this problem:\r\n\r\n- Changing the NuGet package references: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/16305/files#diff-1a76680faf56bc4e70addc531a86cafa\r\n- Work around the property change : https://github.com/jaredpar/roslyn/commit/ee85b65eff117cfffd64508e36f910ba2faad075\r\n- Suites passing after work around: https://ci.dot.net/job/dotnet_roslyn/job/master/job/linux_debug_prtest/1741/console\r\n\r\n",

I've published a new version of the package, `0.1.2-dev` with the Extensions folder removed.  This should fix the issue but there might be other packages which expand with an Extensions folder.  Let me know if something else is broken.\r\n\r\nCC @agocke ",
