This saves a ton of time combing through binlog or imported files.\n> \n> And if you want to indicate the `Code` mapping in RESX, why not add it in the comments? There's a reason that previous text only message tasks had a separate `Code` parameter instead of just putting them in the `Text` parameter.\n\n",
