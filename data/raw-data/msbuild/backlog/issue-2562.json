  "title": "Run custom target once per solution is very slow",
  "body": "We have a custom target that runs once per solution build. We achieved this by adding the target to a dummy project and made every other project dependent on dummy project. Now, in multiprocess scenario(/m) , the node that actually runs that target keeps every other project waiting until it is done with all it's work(builds other big project). So, the time taken increases a lot because of the contention in the node.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to optimize that node since the target on which others are waiting has already completed? If not, any plans to add that feature in near future? Is there any other way possible today to achieve this in multiprocess environment? ",
