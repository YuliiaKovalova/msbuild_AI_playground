Item lists cannot be concatenated with other strings where an item list is expected. Use a semicolon to separate multiple item lists.`\n\n\"Use a semicolon\" is a good suggestion (and should probably be the only one if there's no item transform involved), but there's another common case where you can run into this: when the solution is to move the initial string _inside_ the item transform. We could suggest that rewriting as well:\n\n`error MSB4012: The expression \"{0}\" cannot be used in this context. Item lists cannot be concatenated with other strings where an item list is expected. Use a semicolon to separate multiple item lists, or move {1} inside the item transformation to prefix every transformation output with the string.`\n",
