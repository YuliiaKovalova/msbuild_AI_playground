  "body": "In the projectsystem for our proprietry language X# we have used the MPF codebase.\r\nInside this code after a build is finished the BuildCoda method in the ProjectConfig class is called which will call RefreshReference on every referenced assembly in the projectsystem to update the actual location and hintpath.\r\nFor each of the assemblyreferences in the project the MPF code called:\r\nBuildInstance(this.ProjectMgr, instance, MsBuildTarget.ResolveAssemblyReferences);\r\nWhich would call the ResolveAssemblyReferences task.\r\nFor a project with a dozen assemblyreferences this was called a dozen times. Not very optimal, but it worked until now. With VS 2017 build 15.3 and later this locks up Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nFor now I have worked around this calling the ResolveAssemblyReferences task inside the ProjectConfig.RefreshReference()  method and suppressing the call in the AssemblyReference.ResolveAssemblyReference() method.\r\nThis works, but I think something has changed that might also cause problems for others.\r\nThe code to our project system can be found on \r\nhttps://github.com/X-Sharp/XSharpPublic\r\nMy changes are in \r\nhttps://github.com/X-Sharp/XSharpPublic/blob/master/VisualStudio/ProjectBase/AssemblyReferenceNode.cs\r\nand \r\nhttps://github.com/X-Sharp/XSharpPublic/blob/master/VisualStudio/ProjectBase/ProjectConfig.cs\r\nThe changes are marked with // RvdH \r\n\r\nRobert",
