As part of this change, copies of dynamic libraries are no longer present on the filesystem. Code that attempts to check for dynamic library presence by looking for a file at a path or enumerating a directory will fail. Instead, check for library presence by attempting to `dlopen()` the path, which will correctly check for the library in the cache. (62986286)\r\n\r\n(@akoeplinger pointed this out offline)",

There's still the possibility that Apple just didn't remove this .dylib in the first Beta though so we need to keep an eye on it.",
