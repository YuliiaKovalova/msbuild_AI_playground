  "body": "Our CI builds started failing with a bunch of errors that say.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB4223: A node of the required type OutOfProc could not be created.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/aspnet/Universe\r\ngit checkout 983eb37cd61bee4f97f9bc44914575a9cad150b2\r\nbuild.cmd /p:SkipTests=true /p:CI=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nBuilds should pass. Only [difference in this commit](https://github.com/aspnet/Universe/compare/983eb37cd61bee4f97f9bc44914575a9cad150b2~1...983eb37cd61bee4f97f9bc44914575a9cad150b2) is that we updated to MSBuild version 15.7.169.51914 (via .NET Core CLI 2.1.300-preview3-008646). The previous commit builds with MSBuild  version 15.7.145.53551  (via .NET Core CLI 2.1.300-preview2-008530)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nAbout 15-20 minutes into the build, MSBuild begins to fail with \r\n```\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB4223: A node of the required type OutOfProc could not be created.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternal build logs available here: http://aspnetci/viewLog.html?buildId=452289&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=Releases_21Public_UpdateUniverse and again http://aspnetci/viewLog.html?buildId=452160&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=Releases_21Public_UniverseCoherence.\r\n\r\nWe reverted to the 2.1.300-preview2 CLI to workaround for now.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n```\r\nMSBuild version 15.7.169.51914 for .NET Core\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows Server 2012 R2\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc): dotnet CLI\r\n\r\ncc @rainersigwald possibly related to node reuse changes?\r\n",

Maybe that was wrong.\r\n\r\n@natemcmaster Is it possible to collect additional diagnostic information that should help diagnose this? We log connection attempts and errors to files in `MSBUILDDEBUGPATH` if `MSBUILDDEBUGCOMM=1`, which should include the detailed exception we caught to produce this error.",
