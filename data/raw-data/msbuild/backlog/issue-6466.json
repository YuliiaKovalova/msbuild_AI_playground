  "body": "Console output of MSBuild Server has to be redirected to calling CLI. \r\nAs opposed to child process, where such redirection is done by OS, handling of non-child processes outputs has to be coded.\r\n\r\nWork breakdown:\r\n- define message for console output containing text, foreground and background color \r\n- capture console output in MSBuild Server (text, foreground and background color)\r\n- send captured output by named pipe for each line, accumulated text > 200 characters or when console colors changes.\r\n- receive message in CLI and print it to console.",
