  "title": "Microsoft.NET.StringTools breaks compilation for net462 projects that use AsSpan<T>",
  "body": "The Microsoft.NET.StringTools.net35.dll assembly that nuget chooses when a net462 project installs the Microsoft.NET.StringTools nuget package improperly declares a *public* `System.MemoryExtensions.AsSpan<T>` method (and class). This is exactly the same API that System.Memory is responsible for declaring. As a result, a project that references your package and the latest System.Memory package, while targeting anything less than net472 will fail to compile wherever that project uses the `AsSpan<T>` extension method.\r\n\r\nYou should either make this API `internal`, or otherwise remove it from your surface area for the TFMs where `System.Memory` would declare it.",
