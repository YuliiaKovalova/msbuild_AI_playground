        "body": "Is this on Windows Terminal?  Which version?\n\nThe screen shot looks like the URL was broken because of the window width.  I'm not sure whether the line break was added by MSBuild or by the terminal.  If by MSBuild, then this could perhaps be fixed by making MSBuild recognise URLs in error messages and output OSC sequences to tell the terminal that the URL continues across the line break.  But if the line was broken by the terminal, then the terminal should already understand this.",

I'd suggest raising an issue there. \n\nAt the same time, I think it would be a reasonable suggestion for the TerminalLogger in MSBuild to detect Uris and generate these links taking word wrapping into account, so I'd also love to see a feature request issue there.
