  "title": "MSBuild uses wrong order when Cleaning, causing unregistration of COM components to fail.",
  "body": "When having the \"Register for COM interop\" checked in C# projects, where there are multiple projects that may have dependencies on each other, the order in which the projects are cleaned when running MSBuild on the solution is incorrect.\n\nAttached is a simple solution containing three projects, ComRegTest, ComRegTest2, and ComRegTest3. \nThe ComRegTest2 project references both of the others. When building the projects the build order is correct:\n1. ComRegTest\n2. ComRegTest3\n3. ComRegTest2\n\nBut when running `msbuild ComRegTest.sln /t:Clean /m:1` the order in which the projects are cleaned are: \n1. ComRegTest3\n2. ComRegTest2\n3. ComRegTest1\n\nThis causes an error to occur when cleaning ComRegTest2, saying: \n\n```\nerror MSB3395: Cannot unregister asse mbly \"D:\\Projects\\ComRegTest\\bin\\ComRegTest2.dll\". Could not load file or assembly 'ComRegTest3, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neut ral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\n```\n\nThis problem does not occur when cleaning  from within Visual Studio 2015.\n\n[ComRegTest.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/544987/ComRegTest.zip)\n",
