Exactly one of the probing messages below indicates why we could not resolve the SDK. Investigate and resolve that message to correctly specify the SDK.\r\n  Unable to locate the .NET SDK. Check that it is installed, your PATH is configured for the correct architecture, and that the version specified in global.json (if any) matches the installed version.\r\n  The NuGetSdkResolver did not resolve this SDK because there was no version specified in the project or global.json.\r\n  MSB4276: The default SDK resolver failed to resolve SDK \"Microsoft.NET.SDK.WorkloadAutoImportPropsLocator\" because directory \"C:\\Users\\WDAGUtilityAccount\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Components\\MSBuild\\MSBuild\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.SDK.WorkloadAutoImportPropsLocator\\Sdk\" did not exist.",
