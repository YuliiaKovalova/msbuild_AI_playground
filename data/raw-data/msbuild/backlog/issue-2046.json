This test project targets .NET Framework 4.51 and .NET Core 2.0: netcoreapp2.0;net451\r\n\r\nThe test project build fails with:\r\n\r\nCSC : error CS0006: Metadata file 'C:\\dev\\testproject\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\A.dll' could not be found 2> Done executing task \"Csc\" -- FAILED.\r\n\r\nIt's as if the project A has to have a 'netcoreapp2.0' target. But shouldn't msbuild (which Visual Studio calls to do the build) be happy with it building as a 'netstandard2.0' target?",
