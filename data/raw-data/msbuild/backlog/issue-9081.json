  "body": "Because of the way our bootstrap project references `MSBuild.csproj` in order to collect x86, amd64, and ARM64 copies of files, it winds up rebuilding all of MSBuild for each architecture, as shown in \r\n[PBDL.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/12195738/PBDL.zip).\r\n\r\nThis is skipped in builds driven through the normal script, because in solution context `AssignProjectConfiguration` overrides the MSBuild.csproj references back to the AnyCPU solution configuration. But we shouldn't depend on that.",
