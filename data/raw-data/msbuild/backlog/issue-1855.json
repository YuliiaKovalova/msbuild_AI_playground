  "title": "<PackageReference> doesn't build on command line",
  "body": "I've two projects:\r\n\r\n* `ClassLibrary`. A .NET Framework 4.6.1 class library (using the SDK-style project type). This library depends on JSON.NET.\r\n\r\n* `WpfApp1`. A .NET Framework 4.6.1 WPF app (using the regular MSBuild). The app depends on  `ClassLibrary`.\r\n\r\nHere is the issue: when I'm using `<PackagReference>` from both projects to JSON.NET, I can build and run in the IDE, but when I build on the command line, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\NuGet\\15.0\\Microsoft.NuGet.targets(197,5):\r\n> error : The project.json is referencing the project 'ClassLibrary\\ClassLibrary.csproj',\r\n> but an output path was not specified on an item in the ProjectReferencesCreatingPackages property. [WpfApp1\\WpfApp1.csproj]\r\n\r\nHowever, when I'm converting the WPF app's `<PackagReference>` to `packages.config`, the project builds on both command line and IDE. I can also build in both environments if I remove the WPF app's dependency on JSON .NET entirely. So the root cause seems to be presence of the `<PackagReference>`.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded the repro project [here](https://github.com/terrajobst/Repro_MSBuild_PackagReference).",
