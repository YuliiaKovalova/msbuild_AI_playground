  "body": "I build a project via MsBuild API, using `BuildManager`. So after a build I have `ProjectInstance` object. Is it possible to understand which `ProjectItemInstance` was produced bu which task (or target)? \r\n\r\nI know about `BuildResult.ResultsByTarget` but for some items there is no data there. For example for `Compile` items from `MarkupCompilePass1`. \r\n\r\nThe only was I found so far is pass a logger, specify `BuildParameters.LogTaskInputs = true` and parse log messages. But it is relatively slow =(\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

We don't even have a good event in the engine for \"an item was created\" -- it's just logged as a message.\r\n\r\nMay I ask why you're interested in this? I would generally not expect it to be useful, as most processes and extenders would expect items injected via a new target/task to work as if they were produced by the normal process.",
