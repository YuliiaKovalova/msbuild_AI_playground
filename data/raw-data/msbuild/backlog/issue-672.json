So, my options\nappear to be zero on that front at this point.  I am lucky enough on this\nno admin access machine to already have .net installed on it AND the csc\ncompiler is in the .net directory - so I do have this very lowest common\ndenominator option of writing simple c# apps - and that appears the best\nI'll be able to use.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 2, 2016 at 10:08 AM, Rainer Sigwald notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> MSBuild (the product) does not depend on Visual Studio--you can run\n> MSBuild without VS installed.
