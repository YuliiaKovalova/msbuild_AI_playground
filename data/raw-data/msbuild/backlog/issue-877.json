  "body": "This is generally mostly harmless, but caused @piotrpMSFT and I a lot of grief just now debugging. Because `BuildEnvironmentHelper.Initialize()` is invoked in the static initializer for `BuildEnvironmentHelperSingleton` _in every assembly it's compiled into_, it is a) doing unnecessary work and b) able to produce incorrect results.\n\nTo get incorrect results about where `MSBuild.exe.config` is, have `MSBuild.exe` and `Microsoft.Build.dll` in different directories, and run MSBuild. It tries to locate `MSBuild.exe.config` next to _both_ assemblies. It should live in only one location.\n",
