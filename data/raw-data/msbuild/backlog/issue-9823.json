  "body": "### Background\n\nIn the early prototype we planned to have Rules short ids (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/9735/files#diff-ffa5a8cc14988d03c021f4d451517d358aa148a11ef06068db7298ec7ceac914R24-R33) and Analyzers FriendlyNames. Plus possibly some other identifications (Rules Titles/Categories).\n\nThe scenarios where the identifications might be involved:\n* Findings reporting - the report should nonambiguously point to the rule. Given the current VS error window design, we might be locked to the short id here (prefix + number).\n* Individual rules configuration - e.g. setting the diagnostics level for a particular rule\n* Group of rules configuration - e.g. muting all the rules in a same category/namespace/package - or whatever is decided as a good grouping dimension (if any - we might decide that only 1 by 1 is supported)\n* Errors and execution time reporting for Analyzers - since the unit of the execution is Analyzer (not the Rule), we need some unique identification of the Analyzers as well.\n* Clashes of identification within single build should be prevented. Clashes with well known Rules/Analyzers (specifically the ones we'll ship in-box, or that we might ship in foreseeble future) should be ideally prevented globaly - e.g. by reserving some specific prefixes and preventing registration of custom Analyzers/Rules with those.\n\nThere are some pre-existing lessons learned - e.g - https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/40351#issuecomment-565649667\n\n### Goals\n\n* Research the options of identifying Rules and Anlyzers that satisfy the mentioned scenarios.\n* Cross check with Roslyn team (or whoever was involved with original design) on gotchas and advices.\n* Design and implement the identification of Rules and Analyzers and it's enforcement (e.g. preventing clashes, usage of reserved prefixes, etc.)\n* Implement the group-configuration for rules\n\n\n\n### Related\n * https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/src/Utilities/Compiler/DiagnosticCategoryAndIdRanges.txt\n * https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/40351",
