  "body": "### Summary\n\nAuthors of MSBuild tasks should be able to use utility classes in MSBuild repo.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nI wanted to write a unit test for my custom task and create an test such as https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/a9c95c7251503f85493d3f3bb43780ffa8104589/src/Tasks.UnitTests/Copy_Tests.cs#L131\r\nwhich would use [MockEngine](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/a9c95c7251503f85493d3f3bb43780ffa8104589/src/UnitTests.Shared/MockEngine.cs#L35)\r\nthis is not possible now.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nMove Unit testing classes which can be reused for testing custom tasks to a project that will be published as a NuGet package.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
