  "title": "Question: Restore package in a publish way",
  "body": "Is there any possibility to simply restore a package and all of its dependencies and put them together in one output like a publish build would do it? \r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to create a temporary project with a package reference to the given package and then perform a build on that temporary project. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I need to know the TargetFramework(s) of the package to create a matching temp project and I get additional output (dll) for the temp project, which I actually don't need. I would like to have a common solution that always works, no matter which package I want to restore (even if I don't know its supported target frameworks).",
