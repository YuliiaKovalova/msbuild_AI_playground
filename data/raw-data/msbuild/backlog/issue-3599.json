  "body": "Formatted msbuild resource strings eventually get sent to loggers, which eventually write them to some stream. Most StreamWriters have overloads (or will have) for formatting. Therefore it is pointless to convert formatted resources into strings, if they're final resting place is some buffer anyway.\r\n\r\nAn interesting experiment would be to put the resource and its arguments into some struct, and then propagate that struct all the way into loggers, which then can format them directly into their streams / string builders / etc.\r\n\r\nBuilding WebLargeCore with minimal verbosity creates 74mb of formatted resources:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2255729/43931239-6c07f87a-9bf2-11e8-8263-a16630f16196.png)\r\n\r\nAnd in a broader sense, we should look for cases where we strinbbuild or format strings just to then later put them in some buffer. Patterns that will help\r\n- switch to using ReadOnlyMemory<char> instead of strings\r\n- future corefx work will allow us to retrieve the buffers from stringbuilders\r\n- use formatting overloads\r\n",
