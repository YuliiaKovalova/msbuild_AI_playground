  "body": "### Context\n\nAs a custom application of the Check extension API/OM we should try to author a custom Check (to be hosted outside of MSBuild repo) that is scanning the data for high confindence security patterns being used within the MSBuild scripts\n\n### Details\n\n* We'll likely need to extend our OM to provide access to MSBuild imported files (hook on Import events) - as we want to scan the data contained in scripts, not passed to scripts\n* We can reuse some existing open sourced libraries for classification - ideal candidate: https://github.com/microsoft/security-utilities/blob/main/GeneratedRegexPatterns/HighConfidenceSecurityModels.json\n",
