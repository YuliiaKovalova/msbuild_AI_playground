  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI have a custom MSBuild SDK that builds Zig/C/C++ projects. The 'test suite' consisting of sample projects randomly fails to build on my machine because MSBuild sometimes fails to expand globs for no apparent reason.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/vezel-dev/zig-sdk.git\r\n$ cd zig-sdk\r\n$ ./cake # In a Bash shell.\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSuccessful build.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nErrors of the general form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  cxxexe failed with errors (26,6s)\r\n    **/*.cxx(1,1): error G91F73F44: unable to build C object: Unexpected\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the Zig compiler complaining that it's being passed the literal argument `**/*.cxx`, i.e. MSBuild has failed to expand the glob here: https://github.com/vezel-dev/zig-sdk/blob/6a48e6c8821810ba8053b91419a45ff7bfb8e41f/src/sdk/build/Vezel.Zig.Sdk.Build.props#L20-L22\n\n### Analysis\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any particular pattern to when it happens.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n.NET SDK 8.0.100\r\nMSBuild 17.8.3.51904",
