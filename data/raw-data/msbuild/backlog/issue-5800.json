  "title": "No longer restores package containing both library and analyzer as analyzer",
  "body": "I'm not sure this is the right repository, so please move if not.\r\n\r\n**Version Used**: 16.8 preview 3\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\nI have a source generator https://www.nuget.org/packages/StrongInject/\r\n\r\nThe nuget package contains both a lib, and an analyzer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nanalyzers\\dotnet\\cs\\StrongInject.dll\r\nlib\\netstandard2.1\\StrongInject.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I used it in the past, I included it in my project as so:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"StrongInject\" Version=\"0.0.1-CI-20200915-060298\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the source generator ran (albeit with an error once I updated to VS 16.3 preview 8 as the source generator interface has changed).\r\n\r\nThis morning I restored exactly the same package, and it didn't even run, with or without an error. Similarly when I updated the package it didn't run at all.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it's no longer restored as an analyzer and a library, just as an analyzer",
