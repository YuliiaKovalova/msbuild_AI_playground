These patches can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/tree/release/3.0/patches/msbuild.\r\n\r\nPatches that have the responsibility \"Repo\" and the Disposition \"Incorporate\" are patches that we believe are valid source-build fixes that should be moved into your repo.  Please let us know if these don't seem like good patches.  Any changes with the responsibility \"source-build\" is something that we plan to keep going forward or integrate in another way - please also let us know if you think there may be problems with those patches.\r\n\r\nComplete| Patch name | Type | Disposition | Responsibility | Notes |\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n| \u2714\ufe0f  | msbuild/0001-Add-PackageLicenseExpression.patch | ToolCompat | Remove | source-build | \u00a0\r\n| |msbuild/0002-Enable-full-framework-builds-for-SDK.patch | Build| Remove | source-build | \u00a0SDKs should be able to use reference only msbuild packages.\r\n| \u2714\ufe0f  | msbuild/0003-Don-t-overwrite-source-build-s-MS.NETCore.Compilers-.patch | Flow | Incorporate | Repo | Believe there's an Arcade PR out for this already per our prebuilts discussion\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Looking at this, 0001 was implemented here in #4191. But that's much earlier than the date on the patch; what's the story there?\r\n\r\n0002 confuses me; why do you need full-framework builds in source build at all? They don't contribute to .NET Core builds, right? No objection to building these now that targeting packs are available as nuget packages, but we need to make sure we don't try to test full framework builds on non-Windows systems.\r\n\r\n0003 is obsolete as of #4173.",

We do actually need full-framework builds in source-build because our customers want to be able to use VSCode with a source-built SDK and VSCode requires full framework assemblies.  Good news on 0003, I'll take 0001 and that off the list.",

These can all build against a reference-only msbuild assemblies. ",
