Your report may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.\nFor other types of questions, consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).\n\n-->\n\n### Describe the bug\nIf the project folder has `@` in the name, files with `<CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>` doesn't get copied to the output directory. This works in `9.0.105`, but is broken in `9.0.203`.\nThis causes broken builds for us because Jenkins uses `@2` in folder names when the same pipeline is running multiples times in parallel.\n\n### To Reproduce\n<!--\nWe \u2764 code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo, Gist snippet, or other means to see the isolated behavior.\n\nWe may close this issue if:\n- the repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting\n-->\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrm -rf consoleapp@2\ndotnet new console -o consoleapp@2\ncd consoleapp@2\ndotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 9.0.203 --roll-forward disable\ntouch test.txt\ncat > consoleapp@2.csproj <<EOF\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <None Update=\"test.txt\">\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>\n    </None>\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\nEOF\n\ndotnet build -v diag\nls bin/Debug/net9.0/test.txt\n```\n\nFails with `ls: cannot access 'bin/Debug/net9.0/test.txt': No such file or directory`\n\n\n",
