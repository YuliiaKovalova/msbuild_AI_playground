  "body": "### Context \r\nThe functionality provided by the BuildCheck module is increasing, hence as part of the https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10316 we would like to stabilize the behaviour by running the tests (manual) and fixing bugs if appeared during the effort. \r\n\r\n### Goal \r\n- Validate that documentation of BuildCheck is aligned with actual implementation. \r\n- Validate that MSBuild with enabled BuildCheck runs successfully on Dotnet Repositories ( MSBuild including )\r\n\r\n## Part 1\r\n\r\n### Steps: \r\n1. Prepare repro project and validate/confirm that the documentation and actual implementation (main branch) are aligned \r\n2. In case of finding a bug: Check if it is not reported already if not then please report it :) with the label \"Area: BuildCheck\"\r\n3. In case something is not clear in Documentation that is also an issue, please report it.\r\n\r\n### Categories/Scope/How to s\r\n\r\n- #### Inbox (built-in) analyzers that run during the build execution. \r\n    - How to: \r\n        - [BC0101](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/BuildCheck/Codes.md#BC0101) - shared-output-path ( Person to contact: jankrivanek)\r\n        - [BC0102](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/BuildCheck/Codes.md#BC0102) - double-writes ( Person to contact: jankrivanek)\r\n        - [BC0103](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/BuildCheck/Codes.md#BC0103) -   used-environment-variable ( Person to contact: YuliiaKovalova)\r\n    - Scope: Reproduce the BuildCheck errors on different OS: windows, unix, mac.\r\n\r\n- #### Custom Analyzers \r\n    - Person to contact: YuliiaKovalova\r\n    - How to:\r\n        - https://aka.ms/BuildCheck#custom-analyzers-authoring\r\n    - Scope: Prepare simple build check and integrate it into the solution. \r\n\r\n- #### Configuration \r\n    - Person to contact: f-alizada\r\n    - How to: \r\n        - https://aka.ms/BuildCheck#configuration\r\n    - Scope:\r\n        - Enablment of the rules is configurble and its severity\r\n        - Specification of .editorconfig will be observed\r\n\r\n- #### Tracing \r\n    - Person to contact: maridematte\r\n    - How to: `-v:d` and times should be at the end of logs\r\n    - Scope: \r\n        - Opt-in reporting of time spent via specific analyzers and infra overall.\r\n \r\n- #### Replay mode \r\n    - Person to contact: surayya-MS \r\n    - How to: https://aka.ms/BuildCheck#binlog-replay-mode\r\n    - Scope:  https://aka.ms/BuildCheck#binlog-replay-mode\r\n\r\n## Part 2\r\nThis part contains only of running the MSBuild on existing project with BuildCheck enabled.\r\nSteps: \r\n1. Choose repository in dotnet\r\n2. Run the MSBuild with BuildCheck enabled on selected repository",
