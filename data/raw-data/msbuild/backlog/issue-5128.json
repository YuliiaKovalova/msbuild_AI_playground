  "body": "We use Directory.Build.props in several solutions to inject common PackageReference (StyleCop.Analyzers) to solution's projects to enable linting:\r\n\r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"StyleCop.Analyzers\" Version=\"1.1.118\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />`\r\n\r\nEvery solution contains its own ruleset but the rules are the same.\r\nSo we decided to create one common ruleset and provide it with all necessary files via Nuget package.\r\nThis Nuget package is hosted by our company's Nuget server and it has StyleCop.Analyzers as dependency.\r\n\r\nWe also use other Nuget packages from this server so Visual Studio Nuget package sources contain the url.\r\n\r\nBut if I add PackageReference with this package to Directory.Build.props, Visual Studio (2019) will not restore this package.\r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"NugetPackage.FromInternalFeed\" Version=\"1.0.0\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />`\r\n\r\nI tried Restore Nuget Packages and Build/Rebuild commands from the ui.\r\n\r\nIt seems Nuget packages from custom feeds are ignored and not restored.\r\n\r\nDoes Directory.Build.props ignore Nuget packages from custom feeds?\r\nShould I do some additional actions to enable this process?",
