        "body": "Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Having looked at your project file, I suspect the problem is that BaseOutputPath, despite what our documentation says, isn't properly supported. You might be interested in the PR to fix that [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/5238) and the issue it references [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/1664). I'm going to close this in favor of that issue, but after we've resolved it, if you're still hitting this problem, let me know, and I can reopen this and dig deeper.",
