  "title": "VS2017: MSBuild fails when solution folder name contains space",
  "body": "Apologies if this is the wrong venue, I don\u2019t know of a better place. Please redirect me if appropriate.\r\n\r\nI have installed VS 2017 RC on my Windows laptop, loaded a moderately sized solution (18 projects), and have found that if the full path to a project in a solution folder contains a space, MSBuild will not build that project. Here is what happens:\r\n\r\n1. I have a solution folder called \"Native Components\", and inside that solution folder, a C++ project called NTObjectViewer.Launcher. (A C# project inside a different solution folder also exhibits this bug, as long as the name of the solution folder contains a space.)\r\n2. When I build the project (or press F5 to launch, which does the same thing), I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\Common7\\IDE\\native\\NTObjectViewer\\MSBUILD : error MSB1008 : Only one project can be specified.\r\n  Switch: Components\\NTObjectViewer_Launcher\r\n\r\n  For switch syntax, type \"MSBuild /help\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error points to a number of bugs in how Visual Studio is (trying to) invoke MSBuild. First of all, the project name is not `NTObjectViewer_Launcher`, it is `NTObjectViewer.Launcher`. Second, Visual Studio is not properly quoting paths that contain spaces. Third, the path in the first line does not exist on my system. (It is a portmanteau of the path to `devenv.exe`, and the relative path to the offending C++ project from the solution file.) Fourth, as I understand it solution folders should have no effect on how MSBuild operates. It appears that Visual Studio is passing a path containing a solution folder to MSBuild on the command line. It should not do this.\r\n\r\nTo the extent of my knowledge, all of this worked under VS2015. (However, I cannot test under VS2015, because this solution contains a number of MSBuild-based .NET Core projects, which are not compatible with that version). Any pointers? This is seriously impeding development progress on my project. Thanks!",

Do you have an easy way to repro this? Steps or a minimal repro project. If so we can take a look and pass it on as appropriate. ",
