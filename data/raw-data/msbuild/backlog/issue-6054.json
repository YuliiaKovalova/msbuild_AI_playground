  "title": "Numeric comparison: 9 < 10 but 16.9 > 16.10",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nMSBuild seems to recognize integers when using inequality operators with string operands (which is good), but it fails to recognize floating point numbers as numeric, instead treating them like ordinary strings. This leads to unexpected evaluation of the conditionals.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the repro steps, MSBuild recognizes that `9 < 10`, but fails to recognize that `16.9 < 16.10`. It *does* recognize 4-component versions though, recognizing that `16.9.0.0 < 16.10.0.0`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"versiontest\">\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Text=\"'9' &lt;= '10' \" />\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Condition=\"'9' &lt;= '10' \" Text=\"true\" />\r\n\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Text=\"'16.9' &lt;= '16.10' \" />\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Condition=\"'16.9' &lt;= '16.10' \" Text=\"true\" />\r\n\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Text=\"'16.9.0.0' &lt;= '16.10.0.0' \" />\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Condition=\"'16.9.0.0' &lt;= '16.10.0.0' \" Text=\"true\" />\r\n  </Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n  '9' <= '10'\r\n  true\r\n  '16.9' <= '16.10'\r\n  true\r\n  '16.9.0.0' <= '16.10.0.0'\r\n  true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n  '9' <= '10'\r\n  true\r\n  '16.9' <= '16.10'\r\n  '16.9.0.0' <= '16.10.0.0'\r\n  true\r\n```\r\n",

I thought we had special property functions to deal with that, but apparently it sees them as versions anyway.\r\n\r\nI'd honestly say this is exactly what I'd expect. If you want to compare versions (and have 16.9 be less than 16.10), you can use the version comparison functions.",

This issue just represents the unintuitive experience when you don't know about those property functions where msbuild recognizes integers and a.b.c.d versions automatically but doesn't recognize floating point numbers.
