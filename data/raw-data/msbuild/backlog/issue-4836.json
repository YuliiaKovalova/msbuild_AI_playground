  "body": "MSBuild can throw MSB5009 from this piece of code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/e0116872ef1bf48f1f527d69de64ad58cb7453e0/src/Build/Construction/Solution/ProjectInSolution.cs#L371-L372\r\n\r\nPlease consider throwing the project name or at very least `ParentProjectGuid` of the invalid project. It would assist those trying to find the invalid project (and would have made discovery of #4835 much easier).\r\n\r\nAs it stands the best way (beyond looking at the VCS History to figure out how it was introduced) is to attach the debugger, capture the exception, and then investigate `this` to determine the project, from there you can work backwards to the GUID in question.",
