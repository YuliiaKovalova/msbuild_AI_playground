  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIn the [`use-sourceroot-for-relative-paths`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/tree/use-sourceroot-for-relative-paths) branch I'm working on extending Terminal Logger to read the SourceRoot items in the build to discover the current git repo, if any. This is done  by\r\n\r\na) [opting in to Task Input events](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/use-sourceroot-for-relative-paths/src/MSBuild/TerminalLogger/TerminalLogger.cs#L254-L257)\r\nb) [reacting to the TaskParameterEventArgs events](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/use-sourceroot-for-relative-paths/src/MSBuild/TerminalLogger/TerminalLogger.cs#L702-L712)\r\n\r\nHowever, the opt-in from `IEventSource3.IncludeTaskInputs()` isn't causing the events to be fired.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n* Clone the [`use-sourceroot-for-relative-paths`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/tree/use-sourceroot-for-relative-paths) branch\r\n* Build msbuild with `./build.cmd`\r\n* Copy MSbuild to an 8.0.2xx .NET SDK installation with the enlistment scripts\r\n* Set MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART to 2\r\n* build a project that's in a git repo\r\n* attach a debugger to line 705 in the TerminalLogger.cs file\r\n* see the breakpoint is never hit\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTaskParameterEventArgs events should be sent to the logger\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNo TaskParameterEventArgs events are fired\n\n### Analysis\n\nPer @ladipro, LoggingService.IncludeTaskInputs is not plumbed to interact with BuildParameters.LogTaskInputs. \n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

It looks like the original change in #3253 made us log task inputs if at least one logger requested it, but it was done only for VS. Basically, we need the equivalent of this code to exist on the code path where we do CLI builds:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/8526e850a54170457000221aafb36236a7077062/src/Build/Instance/ProjectInstance.cs#L2488-L2494\r\n\r\nThough, if it's not blocking for @baronfel, I guess it can be parked in backlog",
