  "title": "[Project Graph] Missing transitive project references",
  "body": "In certain cases, some transitive project references nodes are missing\r\n\r\nLooks to be caused by #7053.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems related to `GetTransitiveProjectReferencesExcludingSelfHelper`. For the first cache check I think it may need to change from:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n                if (transitiveReferenceCache.TryGetValue(parsedProject.GraphNode, out HashSet<ProjectGraphNode> cachedTransitiveReferences))\r\n                {\r\n                    traversedReferences.UnionWith(cachedTransitiveReferences);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n                if (transitiveReferenceCache.TryGetValue(parsedProject.GraphNode, out HashSet<ProjectGraphNode> cachedTransitiveReferences))\r\n                {\r\n                    incompleteReferencesOfDirectlyReferencingNode.UnionWith(cachedTransitiveReferences);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if a node has cached transitive references but isn't \"visited\" yet (not in `traversedReferences`), which seems to only happen on the recursive call when it's already in the cache, ie the *third* time it's requested. So the first time, it works because it's computed directly. The second time, its transitive references get added to `traversedReferences` and gets lost from the caller, and the third time on it's pulled from the dictionary again.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above suggestion may mitigate, this logic seems a little suspect overall and probably could be cleaned up to avoid the multiple code locations of checking the cache.",
