  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nSome of the unit tests are failing when run from VS (e.g. `UnusedEnvironmentVariablesDoNotAppearInBinaryLog`).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nRun `UnusedEnvironmentVariablesDoNotAppearInBinaryLog` unit test in VS\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nTest passes\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nTest fails\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThis is caused by the fact that those tests are supposed to execute msbuild and fail to do so due to attempts to interpret the test runner as the dotnet host process:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/cc3db358d34ad4cd1ec0c67e17582d7ca2a15040/src/UnitTests.Shared/RunnerUtilities.cs#L56-L66\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nThis is how sdk achieves similar thing: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Resolvers/Microsoft.DotNet.NativeWrapper/EnvironmentProvider.cs#L65-L94\r\n\r\nAlthough it's sdk specific, it should be sufficient, since the code is supposed to run only for core: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/cc3db358d34ad4cd1ec0c67e17582d7ca2a15040/src/Directory.BeforeCommon.targets#L54\r\n\r\n",
