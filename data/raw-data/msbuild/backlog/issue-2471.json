  "body": "### Proposal\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to check if a target exists or not in a project without the user seeing warnings/errors when it does not.\r\n\r\n### Scenario\r\n\r\nNuGet restore walks all project references by using the `<MSBuild>` element to call a target in child projects. Child projects that do not import common props/targets are missing the restore target display an error to the user. Often it is expected that the target will not exist, for example if the user creates a custom project file and references it.\r\n\r\nSince Restore isn't able to gracefully probe projects the user sees a lot of extra noise when the target is missing. Restore also isn't able to tell the difference between a project that doesn't support restore, and one that has invalid XML or other issues.ore from failing when it should.\r\n\r\n### Possible ways to solve this\r\n\r\n* `<MSBuild>` could provide an option to skip projects where the target doesn't exist\r\n* Provide a way to filter a set of projects based on the existence of a target or property\r\n\r\n",
