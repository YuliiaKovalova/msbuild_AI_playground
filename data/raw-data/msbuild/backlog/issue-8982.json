This can get easily broken by introducing new members and forgotting to add them to `DeepCopy` (as well as `Translate`) methods.\r\nAs suggeted by @rokonec in the comment: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8973#pullrequestreview-1506849652 - leveraging AutoFixture and FluentAssertions can come to quick rescue (we just need to be carefull about members that are not intentionaly cloned - as e.g. [`TaskPropertyInfo.Initialized`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8973/files#diff-7ce2bb316c960faf18775fda5d92caad6e79c7e6c46169890c01d30c1992fc25R40))\r\n\r\n### Note \r\nThis might possibly be advantageous to solve together with https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/8937 ",
