  "body": "context: https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/4644#discussion_r316363861\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are some circumstances that will make the `GenerateResource` task run `RemoveCorruptedFile`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/3885a205f40944174a3e14396547f13db1196b82/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L2896-L2912\r\n\r\nThat method unconditionally emits a warning that the file may be corrupted. But it then immediately deletes it (or emits another error that it couldn't delete it).\r\n\r\nThe warning seems unnecessary. We should bump it down to info and make it more descriptive, maybe something like\r\n\r\n> Attempting to remove possibly-corrupt output file {}.",
