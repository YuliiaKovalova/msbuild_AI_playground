Create overview documenting which clusters/tables are usable and what can we fetch. Put together some sample views (MSBuild usage stats, etc.)\n - [x] Mounting MSBuild telemetry to VS listeners\n - [ ] Defining and exposing data-points for degraded functionality (exceptions, lags/hangs etc.)\n - [ ] Defining and exposing data-points for features usage\n\n### Completed work\n- noted in subissues\n\n## VS Telemetry\n### First iteration (17.14 P2) Completed\n- onboarded VS OpenTelemetry Packages\n- sending on a opt-in basis lenght of the build, Summary of Targets, Tasks and detailed breakdown of runtime of tasks\n  - opt-in can be remotely triggered on VS startup\n\nNote: we had to scale back our efforts due to issues with Perf and reliability in VS (due to taking the new dependencies on VS OTel)\n\n### .NET 10/VS 17.15 (optional)\n- light-weight telemetry that's sent by default for the volume we require\n- degraded functionality datapoints\n- feature usage datapoints\n- heavy-weight telemetry (e.g. the tasks details)",
