  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nContext from https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6106\r\n> [Gen Lu suggested](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1269588) that our previous optprof test \"ManagedLangs\" may not be what we need anymore. I agree, considering our original test included building & typing and we only care about builds.\r\n\r\nWe tried using \"VSPE.OptProfTests.DDRIT_RPS_ManagedLangs_Debug\" test rather than \"ManagedLangs.OptProfTests.DDRIT_RPS_ManagedLangs\" for optprof runs, but that resulted in a refset image delta RPS failure from ManagedLangs. See https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/304486.\r\n\r\nLet's figure out what the minimal set of tests we should be running are.",
