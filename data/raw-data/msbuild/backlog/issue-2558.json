  "title": ".NET Framework application should automatically use NuGet packages from referenced class libraries",
  "body": "A .NET framework (version 4.6.1) VB console project references (via project reference) a .NET Framework (version 4.6.1) class library. The NuGet packages referenced by the class library (via `PackageReference`) are not restored in the console application which results in a `DllNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\nAccording to this [article by Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ReferencingNETStandardAssembliesFromBothNETCoreAndNETFramework.aspx), as well as issues on GitHub (e.g. #1582 ), there are problems when combining .NET Standard and .NET Framework. However, in this example the class library as well as console application both target .NET Framework 4.6.1.\r\n\r\n## Reproduce Error by\r\n\r\nClone [this repository](https://github.com/suchja/nuget-references-problem), build the solution and run it. I do get an `TypeInitializationException` with an inner exception of type `DllNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\nComparing the output folder of the console application `NuGetRefTest` with the class library output folder `LibWithRef` shows that some assemblies are missing while others are available.\r\n\r\nAvailable (in output folder of class library and console app):\r\n\r\n - Emgu.CV.UI.dll\r\n - Emgu.CV.World.dll\r\n - ZedGraph.dll\r\n \r\nMissing (from console app, but available in class library):\r\n \r\n - Emgu.CV.UI.GL.dll\r\n - OpenTK.dll\r\n - OpenTK.GLControl.dll\r\n - x64/cvextern.dll\r\n - x64/opencv_ffmpeg310_64.dll\r\n - x86/cvextern.dll\r\n - x86/opencv_ffmpeg310.dll\r\n \r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\n 1. Add NuGet package to console application (while keeping it in class library as well). - This works and solves the problem, but is not what I expect to see.\r\n 2. Add `<RestoreProjectStyle>PackageReference</RestoreProjectStyle>` to the console application's csproj file. - Rebuilding and running it shows the same error.",
