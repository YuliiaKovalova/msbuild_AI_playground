        "body": "Hey @BrandonHilligenn - since the MSBuild team doesn't own the build tasks/targets for building and publishing to Android devices I'm going to transfer this to the dotnet/maui repo. They should be able to help triage the issue faster/with more context, and if there is an issue in the underlying MSBuild engine or the Common targets that live here, we can come back to it.\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting!\r\n\r\n_actually_ I lack permissions to transfer this to dotnet/maui, so could you please re-open this there?",
