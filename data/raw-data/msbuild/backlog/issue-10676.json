  "title": "[Feature Request]: Update docs for clarity about different Logger behaviors",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nWe need to revamp the docs around\r\n\r\n* logger CLI switcher\r\n* kinds of loggers provided by MSBuild\r\n\r\nto help explain how `--verbosity` applies differently to different loggers, especially the differences between the Console Logger and Terminal Logger.\r\n\r\nWe need a place to discuss the expectations, formats and experiences that each Logger brings, as well as some kind of decision-making helper for users to decide what logger to use.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nUsers view certain aspects of TL as a take-back (especially power users that write MSBuild logic) and we need a place to put guidance about the different loggers\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nNew docs specifically focusing on the shipped Loggers to place these details.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
