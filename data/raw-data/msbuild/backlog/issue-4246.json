Do those machines have full Visual Studio or also Build Tools? Are they running the exact same version of Windows and the Windows SDK?",

I doubt it has uploaded all the 62MB of it, could you verify?\r\n\r\nAlso, as for the question concerning exact same version of Windows and the Windows SDK - could you give me a command that I can run on the different build agents which output would give you all the information? I can run it on the new and the old build agents and include the results in the issue.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
