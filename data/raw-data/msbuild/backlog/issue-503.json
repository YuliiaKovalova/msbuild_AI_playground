  "body": "This method essentially converts paths of the form\n\n`/framework/base/path/vA.B/foo` to `/framework/base/path/xbuild/vA.B/bin/foo` \n\n.. if A.B > 4.0 .\n\nI am not sure why this is required or when it might be hit. The `xbuild/*/bin` path\ncontains the Microsoft.Build\\* assemblies for versions 12.0 and 14.0..\nBut how would we get a resolved path to these?\n\nAlso, this gets applied to results of property/item expansions via `MaybeAdjustFilePath`,\nwhich means that any Property containing such a path gets adjusted. And this can get\napplied multiple times, so ..\n\n`<Foo>/Users/ankit/dev/misc/lib/mono/v8.0/asd</Foo>`\n\n.. becomes ..\n\n`/Users/ankit/dev/misc/lib/mono/xbuild/8.0/bin/bin/asd` \n\nSo, my question is why is this useful?\n",
