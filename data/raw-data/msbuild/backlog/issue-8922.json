However it should be easy to get rid of it and so completely remove `TranslateDotnet`\r\n\r\n### Suggested approach\r\nIt seems all we need are actually 'ConfigurationBytes' (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Shared/TaskLoader.cs#L95-L99) - so instead of remoting whole `AppDomainSetup`, transfer only `byte[]`",
