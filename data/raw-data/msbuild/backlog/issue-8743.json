  "title": "[Feature Request]: Add 'IfDifferent' mode for CopyToOutputDirectory metadata",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently `CopyToOutputDirectory` can only be `Never`, `Always` and `PreserveNewest`. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items)\r\nThis can cause problems when the content file is for some reason changed to the _older_ copy, but still expected to be copied.\r\n\r\nSample scenarios when this might be needed:\r\n* Nuget content files copy on downgrading package (https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12578)\r\n* Decreasing the motivation to use `Allways` (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7654)\r\n* Reverting/Undeleting files via OS or 3rd pty functionality (not git - as it always updates timestamps)\r\n* Source/Version control system that preserves timestamps (e.g. Subversion with `use-commit-times=yes`)\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nEither add `IfDifferent` mode, or make the `Always` mode behave that way (as e.g. discussed here: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7654#issuecomment-1142246110)\r\n",
