  "title": "The _GetProjectReferenceTargetFrameworkProperties target doesn't work for multiple projects with same identity",
  "body": "The [`_GetProjectReferenceTargetFrameworkProperties` target](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/a6f6699d1f70bf79db82030938d2c5e52d1e4d2e/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L1706) is responsible for annotating ProjectReference items with various metadata (`SetTargetFramework`, `UndefineProperties`, ...). When specifying multiple `ProjectReference` items with the same identity, the metadata isn't applied which results in the wrong target framework, runtime identifier and self contained settings being passed to the project.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>net7.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\b\\b.csproj\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\b\\b.csproj\" ReferenceOutputAssemlby=\"false\" OutputItemType=\"CustomAdditionalCompileInputs\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error\r\nAs the `TargetFramework` global property isn't undefined, `net7.0` is passed down to the child project, which only targets `net6.0` and `net5.0`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\temp\\tfm\\a>dotnet build\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  All projects are up-to-date for restore.\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.101\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets(267,5): error NETSDK1005: Assets file 'C:\\temp\\tfm\\b\\o\r\nbj\\project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'net7.0'. Ensure that restore has run and that you have included 'net7.0' in the TargetFrameworks for your project. [\r\nC:\\temp\\tfm\\b\\b.csproj::TargetFramework=net7.0]\r\n\r\nBuild FAILED.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMinimal repro: [tfm.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/10320741/tfm.zip)\r\n\r\nReason for that are the `'@(AnnotatedProjects)' == '%(Identity)'` checks in the condition statements: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L1891\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me why these statements exist in the first place. When I remove them, everything works as expected. Those were added by @AndyGerlicher in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/57ae27cf0812bf262c6f8be456ed527a1542dba7. I assume that those were necessary with a previous version of MSBuild and can be removed now.\r\n\r\ncc @rainersigwald ",
