  "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks one of the BuildCheck analyzers we would like to ship in-box with MSBuild.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nImplement an analyzer with the following rule: No implicit property derived from an environment variable is used during the build.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nDepending on the environment leads to build reproducibility problems. Properties should instead be passed to MSBuild explicitly on the command line with `/p`.",
