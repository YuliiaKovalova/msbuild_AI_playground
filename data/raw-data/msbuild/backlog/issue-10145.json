  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nWe need to distinguish restore is happening for the BuildCheck feature (namely for https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9747)\r\nThis is not currently possible until receiving BuildEvaluationFinished.\r\nTeam decided that it's more future wise to add the full event with all the relevant info, rather than reusing BuildEvaluationStarted event.\r\n\r\n**Blocked by:**  https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10172\r\n\r\n### What should be done\r\n* Create new BuildEventArg - named BuildSubmissionStarted\r\n* Add the followind data (they will be sourced from common base of `BuildRequestData` and `GraphBuildRequestData` introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10172):\r\n  * EntryProjectFullPath(s)\r\n  * TargetNames\r\n  * Flags (note - the ClearCachesAfterBuild flag might be helpful in the future for BuildCheck dedup)\r\n  * GlobalProps\r\n  * SubmissionId (from the `PendBuildRequest` functions) \r\n* Send the event through logging from a location all requests go through (probably  https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10172/files#diff-2b0716a511d8f4ee690ebd5c3a59dec1e3f9a5eab4ab2a80a1018820a658accbR1370)\r\n* Ensure proper de/serialization in BuildEventsArgReader/Writer\r\n* Increment binlog version, Create Binlog viewer PR (todo: give further instructions here)\r\n\r\n### Additional notes\r\n\r\nThis work would ideally unify with:\r\n* [ ]  `BuildCheckTracingEventArgs` de/serialization\r\n* [ ] https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10244 (once https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10055 is merged)\r\n* [x] https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10146",
