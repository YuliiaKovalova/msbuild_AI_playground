  "body": "When running `msbuild`, `dotnet build` or `dotnet msbuild` in the project below, I get the error:\r\n\r\n    C:\\repo-path\\sample\\dirs.proj : error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.Build.Traversal' specified could not be found.\r\n\r\nHere's the project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project DefaultTargets=\"Build\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\" Sdk=\"Microsoft.Build.Traversal\">\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n     <ProjectFile Include=\"Sample\\Sample.csproj\" />\r\n     <ProjectFile Include=\"SampleTest\\SampleTest.csproj\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running with `-v diag`, I've noticed that it does not attempt to install or restore the SDK.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to install that SDK manually either. Documentation at [https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks) and [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk) doesn't explain how to install. They just say that restore is automatic.\r\n\r\nI also attempted `-target:Restore` but it says ` Target \"Restore\" skipped. The target does not exist in the project and SkipNonexistentTargets is set to true.`\r\n\r\n## msbuild version\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\repo-path\\sample>\"c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\" --version\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.9.0+5e4b48a27 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

I confirm that in both cases it's searching the msbuild SDK on directory `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\{dotnet-SDK-version}\\Sdks\\Microsoft.Build.Traversal\\Sdk`, and it's not finding there because it does not exist.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to install the msbuild SDK manually or what to do to fix the environment.",
