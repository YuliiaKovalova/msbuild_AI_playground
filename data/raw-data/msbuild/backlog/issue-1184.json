  "title": "Documentation: Exists silently un-escapes arguments",
  "body": "`FunctionCallExpressionNode` represents the AST node for property functions inside msbuild conditions.\r\n\r\nThe [hardcoded special logic](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Evaluation/Conditionals/FunctionCallExpressionNode.cs#L36) for the `Exists` method calls into `ExpandArgumentForScalarParameter` which expands the argument [as if it were a task item](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Evaluation/Conditionals/FunctionCallExpressionNode.cs#L116).\r\n\r\n[TaskItem](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Instance/ProjectItemInstance.cs#L726) represents items passed into tasks. A TaskItem unconditionally unescapes its strings. This kind of makes sense, since tasks should see unescaped data.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems a bit weird to interpret all arguments passed to the `Exists`property function as TaskItems.\r\n\r\nOne outcome out of this, is that in the following snippet:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n   <p1>123%40.cs</p1>\r\n   <p2 Condition=\"Exists($(p1))\">condition was true</p2>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe condition will apply to `123@.cs` and not to `123%40.cs` because [TaskItem unescapes it under the covers](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Instance/ProjectItemInstance.cs#L877). \r\n\r\nIs this a bug or a feature? If it's a feature, the code that implements it is doing so by using the hidden side-effect of TaskItems (an object meant to represent items sent to tasks) rather than by clearly expressing the intent to unescape arguments to `Exists`.\r\n",
