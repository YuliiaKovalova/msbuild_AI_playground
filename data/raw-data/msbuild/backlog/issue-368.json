  "title": "Item Functions are not parsed correctly in conditions",
  "body": "This came up on an internal mailing list.  A user was trying to emit a message if an item didn't contain a certain element, and I recommended using the [Item Function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee886422.aspx) `AnyHaveMetadataValue`.  But that produces an error:\n\n``` xml\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <MainEmbeddedFiles Include=\"foo.baml\" />\n    <MainEmbeddedFiles Include=\"UserControl1.baml\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n\n  <Target Name=\"b\">\n    <Error Text=\"Missing expected BAML file!!!\"\n           Condition=\"!@(MainEmbeddedFiles->AnyHaveMetadataValue('Filename', 'UserControl1'))\" />\n  </Target>\n</Project>\n```\n\n``` console\nd:\\play>msbuild test.proj /v:q /nologo\nd:\\play\\test.proj(9,12): error MSB4092: An unexpected token \")\" was found at character position 71 in condition \"!@(MainEmbeddedFiles->AnyHaveMetadataValue('Filename', 'UserControl1'))\".\n```\n\nThis can be worked around by creating a property:\n\n``` xml\n  <Target Name=\"b\">\n    <PropertyGroup>\n      <HasFile>@(MainEmbeddedFiles->AnyHaveMetadataValue('Filename', 'UserControl1'))</HasFile>\n    </PropertyGroup>\n    <Error Text=\"Missing expected BAML file!!! @(MainEmbeddedFiles->AnyHaveMetadataValue('Filename', 'UserControl1'))\"\n           Condition=\"!$(HasFile)\" />\n  </Target>\n```\n\nI see no reason that we should behave differently in a `Condition`.\n",

        "body": "@nikson Yes, this is still up for grabs. However, it's in a part of the code that hasn't seen changes in a while, so we'd like to be cautious. If you'd like to take a look, can you post a quick summary of the changes you think you'll make before going all the way through the fix? (Of course, if it's easier to just send a PR with a proposed fix, that's fine, but I'd like to potentially save some of your time by considering an approach first.)\n",
