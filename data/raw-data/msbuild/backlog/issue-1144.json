  "body": "The fact that every environment variable becomes an msbuild property can seem convenient, but has proven to be a source of bugs that are extremely hard to track down and fix. There should be a way to opt out a project or msbuild.exe invocation.\n\nPerhaps a command-line switch to msbuild.exe would be simplest, and dotnet CLI could always pass it, to push new uses towards the safer default.\n\n@rainersigwald @eerhardt @livarcocc\n",
