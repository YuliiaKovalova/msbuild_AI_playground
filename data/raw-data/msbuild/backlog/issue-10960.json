  "title": "ProjectImported OM should only exist in logger thread context",
  "body": "### Context\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10959#discussion_r1834738830\n\nThe `_deferredProjectEvalIdToImportedProjects` should be ensured to be called only from the `BuildEventArgs` handlers - so in a synchronized context. Then we can gt rid of any synchronization on it\n\n### What needs to be done\n\nThe handler of `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler.HandleProjectEvaluationStartedEvent` and `ProcessProjectEvaluationStarted` needs to be separated, as currently we cannot distinguish the situation \"ProjectEvaluationStartedEvent occured, but it was received through logging infrastructure\".\n\nThe reason for the 2 possible sources of the event (through the logging or directly from engine) is due to the fact that the BuildCheckManager can live in the worker node as well.\n\nThe `ProjectImported` data are to be received only via the logging infrastructure - so it should be handled only in the handler of `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler.HandleProjectEvaluationStartedEvent`. Since the logging infra guarantees synchronized (single threaded) delivery of events - we can then be sure that all handling of the `ProjectImported` data happens without concurrency risks and any synchronization (or usage of ConcurrentDictionary) can be removed. This should significantly simplify the code\n",
