        "body": "This isn't just an inconsistency, it's a horrible, horrible hack to fail the build due to some \"standard error and warning format\" messages. This so-called \"standard format\" isn't even documented on the linked MSDN page and this is certainly unexpected behaviour for someone creating a pre-build or post-build step in Visual Studio. This hack should certainly be off by default, like the documentation says it is and if someone does want to turn it on, they should have documentation on exactly what strings it looks for.\r\n\r\nLooks like I'm not the only one to run into it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39466090/why-outputting-error-in-post-build-event-breaks-my-build-in-vs2012",
