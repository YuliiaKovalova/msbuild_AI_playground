  "body": "We use [EditBin to set the `LargeAddressAware` flag](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/e49204a31550c8a0a53a99013a23c765d02b4dfb/dir.targets#L168-L170) for MSBuild.  This requires the C++ tools to be installed and we don't want to fail local builds if they aren't, so we use `WarnAndContinue` on the task.  However, as part of [upgrading the toolset](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2706), I enabled the `/warnaserror` flag.\r\n\r\nIt turns out these don't work well together, as the warning from `WarnAndContinue` just gets promoted to a build error at the end and the build fails.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what a good solution would be.  Perhaps there should be a `MessageAndContinue` value for `ContinueOnError`.  Or perhaps `/warnaserror` shouldn't be enabled in local builds.",
