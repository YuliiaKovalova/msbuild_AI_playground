  "body": "This issue looks a lot like #2621.  I'm not sure it is the same exact issue, but logging it here since this doesn't appear to be a regression - it repros with .NET Core SDK 2.0.2.\r\n\r\nHere's my repro:\r\n\r\n[test.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1377967/test.zip)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n        <PublishDir>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)</PublishDir>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n    <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n        <ItemGroup>\r\n            <SdkFiles Include=\"$(PublishDir)/**/*\"\r\n                      Exclude=\"$(PublishDir)/Sdks/**/*\" />\r\n        </ItemGroup>\r\n    </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnzip that and run `dotnet.exe msbuild .\\test.proj /v:diag` and inspect the `SdkFiles` item.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that the `SdkFiles` item contains files from the `Sdks` folder, which should have been excluded.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n1. This only repros on Windows, it doesn't seem to repro on Linux.\r\n1. If I move the `<ItemGroup>` outside of the `<Target>`, then the globbing works as expected - the files in the `Sdks` folder are excluded.\r\n1. One thing that leads me to believe my scenario is different is because I can repro this using both the `2.0.2` .NET Core SDK and the `2.1.0-preview` .NET Core SDK from master.",
