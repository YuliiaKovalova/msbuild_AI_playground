Everything was still working on [6.0.100](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/runs/5148391742?check_suite_focus=true).\r\n\r\nI'm still using `Microsoft.Build.*` packages in version 16.9.0, mainly because those still target `netcoreapp2.1` and my library also has to run as custom MSBuild tasks.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe error reproduces easily on local machine: https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/tree/repro/msbuild-locator\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMSBuild assemblies are still correctly resolved.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Build, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n```\r\n",
