  "body": "* [ ] Eric Arndt's Eval Perf PRs\n  * I've asked Eric to help us with splitting #11273 to smaller pieces.\n    * [x] #11780 \n    * [x] #11779\n    * We landed most of Erics PRs, two remain.\n    * [ ] #11852 - looks good, for some reason two tests failed. But some of our tests are flaky - re running.\n    * [ ] #11802 - killed pipelines in a weird way, hanging since. @Erarndt \n  * #11271 - Approved. Waiting for VS insertion to finish. There were some issues with tests, possibly unrelated. Re-running the pipeline.\n* [ ] Eric Arndt spike multi-threaded eval\n  * discussion in progress. Will update as we go along and eventually create a separate ticket. \n  * We're moving ahead with this one. There will be a new ticket soon-ish I think.",
