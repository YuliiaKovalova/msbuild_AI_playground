I wonder if it is possible to use [Process.StandardInput](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.standardinput) to write to do that? I see that StandardInput is used in the [source code](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/6851538897f5d7b08024a6d8435bc44be5869e53/src/Utilities/ToolTask.cs#L868), but I don't understand how I can use this in my own code.",
