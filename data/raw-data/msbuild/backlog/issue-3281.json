  "body": "The code starts a normal task and call into this method, which doesn't exit.  It will take one thread out of the thread pool, and when the overall number goes lower, it can lead into thread pool exhaustion issue.\r\n\r\nThe fix is easy, you need pass a flag to tell CLR that this is a long run task, so it starts it with a new thread.  (Or you can create your own thread to run this proc.)",
