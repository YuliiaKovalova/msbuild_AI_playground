        "body": "I have identified the reason for the double build to be due to a new global property when building for more than one target platform. The value for the TargetFramework global property would be different and trigger a new build even though the custom project does not consumes the value of that property.\r\nUsing the RemoveProperties attribute of the MSBuild task with the values equal to the names of the properties that are not used by the target project seems to make it work.\r\nIdeally I would like to have a way to disable global properties being passed over to the build of that project (e.g. RemoveAllProperties=\"true\").",
