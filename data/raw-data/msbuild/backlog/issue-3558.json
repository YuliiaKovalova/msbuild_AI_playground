  "body": "### Overview\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9477 and https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/3535 for some context.\r\n\r\nBasically, when a C# or VB project is multitargeting, the `DefaultProjectTypeGuid` property that `dotnet` uses for `dotnet sln add` is not set because the language targets where the property is actually set are not evaluated for multitargeted projects.\r\n\r\nThe .NET Core SDK is going to implement a workaround for 2.1.4xx, but the workaround is not ideal because it is expected that the language targets set `DefaultProjectTypeGuid` and not the SDK.\r\n\r\nNote that it would be ideal if `Language` and any other language-describing properties also get set when evaluating a multitargeting project.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `dotnet new console`\r\n2. Edit the project file and change `TargetFramework` to `TargetFrameworks` (the project is now \"multitargeting\").\r\n3. `dotnet new sln`\r\n4. `dotnet sln add .`\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nThe project is added to the solution.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject 'foo.csproj' has an unknown project type and cannot be added to the solution file. Please contact your SDK provider for support.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: if using a .NET SDK that implements the workaround, this is expected to succeed instead.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet --info\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   2.1.300\r\n Commit:    adab45bf0c\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     arch\r\n OS Version:  \r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         linux-x64\r\n Base Path:   /opt/dotnet/sdk/2.1.300/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 2.1.2\r\n  Commit:  811c3ce6c0\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  2.1.300 [/opt/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.2 [/opt/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.2 [/opt/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.2 [/opt/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```",
