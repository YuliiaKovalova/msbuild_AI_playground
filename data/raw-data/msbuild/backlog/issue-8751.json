  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhile attempting to publish a .NET solution with dotnet publish, the following error message is encountered:\r\n\r\n\"MSBUILD : error MSB4166: Child node \"5\" exited prematurely. Shutting down. Diagnostic information may be found in files in when doing dotnet publish sln\". (sometimes it is \"2\" or \"3\" totally random). Resources looks good we are not out of resources.\r\n\r\nThis happens at random and no more information is provided what is wrong. On some build agents it is consistent. We even rebuild few of them but this issue persists. /nr:false does not have an effect on this. Also this is happening when doing dotnet test. It started recently without any change on build agents.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCannot provide logs from our build agents.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nError message which will point to the real issue.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nUnclear error message.\n\n### Analysis\n\nWe tried to resolve it for couple of days without luck.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n17.5.0.10706",

You would not want to have your build all the time this way, but it could catch the error.",
