  "title": "\u201cMSB0001: Internal MSBuild Error: Already registered for build-time\u201d in Visual Studio 15.8.0",
  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Check out minimal reproducible example from the repository https://github.com/iainnicol/ReproForMsbuildAlreadyRegisteredForBuildTime\r\n2. Open the .sln inside version 15.8.0 of the Visual Studio GUI\r\n3. Build menu -> Build Solution\r\n\r\nThe key part of this minimal example is that the solution has one C# project (either old or new style csproj), plus two F# projects (old style fsproj). By \"new style\" I mean using the modern MSBuild SDK, and by old style I mean the format which predates that.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nBuilds successfully.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nBuild fails due to an internal MSBuild Error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1>------ Build started: Project: fsharp1, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------\r\n2>------ Build started: Project: fsharp2, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------\r\n2>Unhandled Exception:MSB0001: Internal MSBuild Error: Already registered for build-time.\r\n2>Error: MSB0001: Internal MSBuild Error: Already registered for build-time.\r\n3>------ Build started: Project: csharp, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------\r\n3>  csharp -> C:\\git\\ReproForMsbuildAlreadyRegisteredForBuildTime\\csharp\\bin\\Debug\\csharp.dll\r\n1>\t\tfsharp1 -> C:\\git\\ReproForMsbuildAlreadyRegisteredForBuildTime\\fsharp1\\bin\\Debug\\fsharp1.dll\r\n========== Build: 2 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that subsequent builds may succeed, so you may need to run\r\n```\r\ngit clean -dfx\r\n```\r\nto reproduce again.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\nWindows 10, version 1803, OS Build 17134.191.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio v15.8.0.  The issue is not present in v15.7.x.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nWeirdly, running msbuild from a Visual Studio command line (VsDevCmd.bat) is successful. I only see the failure inside the Visual Studio GUI.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a [thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/311575/exceptionmsb0001-internal-msbuild-error-already-re.html) Visual Studio forum, where others have encountered the issue.",
