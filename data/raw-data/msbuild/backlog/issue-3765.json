  "body": "The command line help text uses slashes (`/foo`) instead of dashes (`-foo`).\r\nFor increased xplat compatibility, they should be switched to the dash style argument form similar to the change made to roslyn's help (`dotnet /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.402/Roslyn/bincore/csc.dll -help`).\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/7732 for a .NET docs issue. Changing it everywhere (help text, .NET docs, VS docs) would be great.",
