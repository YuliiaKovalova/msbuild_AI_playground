We need to move to machine images that have a newer one installed.\r\n\r\nThat might mean that we need to ask for such images to be created.\r\n\r\n@mmitche This can wait until 2.1 RTM madness is over, but when you get a chance we'll probably need your help with getting updated Mono installed on CI images.",
