  "body": "@olgaark pointed this out offline, thanks!\r\n\r\nThe help text for the `/v` switch is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/verbosity:<level> Display this amount of information in the event log.\r\n                   The available verbosity levels are: q[uiet], m[inimal],\r\n                   n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic]. (Short form: /v)\r\n                   Example:\r\n                     /verbosity:quiet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implies that it will apply to any log attached (unless specifically overridden by a logger parameter). That's . . . almost true! But it's not true for the most easily-attached logger, the file logger, which [defaults to `Detailed`](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/00ff8ba81a8046f87a4476d5f14113e0088c5ca4/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L2705-L2707) unless `/fileloggerparameters` is specified.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think we can enforce consistency by changing the default verbosity of file loggers to be the specified \"overall\" verbosity -- that would probably break user build scripts.\r\n\r\nI'd like to update the help text, but I can't think of a concise way to describe this that doesn't invite more confusion.",
