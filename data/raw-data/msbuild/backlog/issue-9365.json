  "title": "[Feature Request]: File Version Info customization is limited",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nThe File Version Info customization is very limited. For example, while you can set the output `File Version`, `Copyright`, `Company`, you cannot set the `File description` field, or the `Original filename` field.\r\n\r\n(The fields I'm talking about)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/61495410/e1974bb7-af1a-4621-91c0-56b4dd431410)\r\n\r\nIf there is an existing work-around, please let me know because it's a bit urgent for me.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on an application that has a custom exe name, but its process name (in task manager) should be something else. The problem is that the task manager takes the `File description` field as the process name.\r\n\r\nAs for the `Original filename` field, my built application has to be renamed after it's built and I don't want to reveal the original name of the application, so I want to replace the field value with something else.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nBoth could have their own csproj properties.\r\nFor example:\r\n```xml\r\n<FileDescription>Hello World</FileDescription>\r\n<OriginalFilename>CoolApp.exe</OriginalFilename>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n_No response_",
