  "body": "On ProjectReferences and PackageReferences.\r\n\r\nWe gotta start unifying this between MSBuild, the SDK, and NuGet.\r\n\r\n## Lingering Questions\r\n- What does CopyLocal default to?\r\n- What's the logic behind `Private=true` meaning \"copy my stuff over\"\r\n- `Private` (MSBuild) flows through items, does that change the behavior in RAR? Or only the \"output\" behavior?\r\n- Projects need to be able to tell things that reference it: Don't copy this item\r\n\t- What controls this?\r\n\r\nCopyLocal & Private are equivalent but exist in different systems.\r\nCopyLocal (NuGet) <==> Private (MSBuild)\r\n\r\n### Private (MSBuild)\r\nPrivate (MSBuild): Controls copying the output. Doesn't affect referencing.\r\n- Flows to references, flows to RAR.\r\n- Same as `ExcludeAssets=runtime`\r\n**False**: \"Don't copy _anything_ to the output directory\"\r\n**True** (default): Let stuff copy \r\n\r\n`Private` flows to new `Reference` items, and flows to `ResolveAssemblyReferences`.\r\nSame as `ExcludeAssets=runtime`\r\n\r\n### CopyLocal (NuGet)\r\n_\"Do I take the thing and put it in the output folder?\"_\r\n**True**: Let stuff copy\r\n**False**: Don't copy anything to outdir.\r\n\r\n### ReferenceOutputAssembly (MSBuild)\r\nTrue: Pass references to the compiler. Include that in output.\r\n\tUltimately decides if the dll gets copied, even when `Private=true`\r\nFalse: Don't pass reference to compiler, don't include in output.\r\n\tDoes this override `Private=true`?\r\n\r\n[LEGACY] `ReferenceOutputAssembly` is equivalent to excludeassets=all. Its referenced, but nothing happens.\r\n\r\n### ExcludeAssets (NuGet)\r\n_\"Do I reference compile, do I copy runtime?_\r\nThis needs a better quote, not sure I captured this.\r\n`all`: Don't reference and don't copy it out.\r\n\r\n### PrivateAssets (NuGet)\r\n_\"What flows through me to my references?\"_\r\n\r\nThe goal here is probably to create `ExcludeAssets`/`PrivateAssets` equivalents in MSBuild.",
