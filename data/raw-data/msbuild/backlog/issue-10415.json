  "title": "[Feature Request]: Design and implement progress messages API",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nDesign and implement a new API for progress reporting for Tasks. \r\nConsume and show progress messages in new Terminal Logger.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nMany messages that are logged by the tasks are ephemeral and reporting the progress of the task. It would be beneficial to create an API to distinguish such messages and be able to process them in the loggers, especially Terminal Logger. After implementing we shall work with other teams to migrate usage of `message-as-progress-reporting` to the new progress message API.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nNo details yet.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
