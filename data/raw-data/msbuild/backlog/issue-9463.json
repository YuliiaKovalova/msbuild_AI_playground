  "title": "[Bug]: class MSBuildGlob should expose GlobRoot and FileSpec as public properties",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe project system evaluation cache serializes glob information into the evaluation cache and reconstructs the globs when loading the data.\r\nHowever, the GlobRoot and FileSpec properties are not available as public properties which prevents a proper reconstruction of the glob objects when loading the cache.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/Globbing/MSBuildGlob.cs\r\n\r\nThey are currently exposed as 2 internal properties:\r\n```CSharp\r\n        internal string TestOnlyGlobRoot => _state.Value.GlobRoot;\r\n        internal string TestOnlyFileSpec => _state.Value.FileSpec;\r\n```\r\nHowever that has a few issues:\r\n- the 2 properties are internal instead of public\r\n- The property name contains \"Test\"\r\n- Calling the 2 properties would trigger the lazy calculation, which can be avoided because the 2 values are known from the beginning\r\n\r\nThe 2 properties should be exposed on the class itself and be removed from GlobState struct so that they don't require the Lazy calculation and also don't duplicate the data.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nThis is API only\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n```CSharp\r\n        internal string GlobRoot { get; }\r\n        internal string FileSpec { get; }\r\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n```CSharp\r\n        internal string TestOnlyGlobRoot => _state.Value.GlobRoot;\r\n        internal string TestOnlyFileSpec => _state.Value.FileSpec;\r\n```\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
