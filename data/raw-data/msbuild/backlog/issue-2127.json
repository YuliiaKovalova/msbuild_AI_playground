  "title": "[MSBuild]::IsOsPlatform implementation breaks API intent of RuntimeInformation",
  "body": "I just stumbled over https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/1950. The implementation of the `[MSBuild]::IsOsPlatform` property function has a questionable implementation, it whitelists only members in the OSPlatform struct:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate static Lazy<string> _validOsPlatforms = new Lazy<string>(\r\n             () => typeof(OSPlatform).GetTypeInfo()\r\n                 .GetProperties(BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public)\r\n                 .Where(pi => pi.PropertyType == typeof(OSPlatform))\r\n                 .Select(pi => pi.Name)\r\n                 .Aggregate(\"\", (a, b) => string.IsNullOrEmpty(a) ? b : $\"{a}, {b}\"),\r\n             true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is against the API design of RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(), after a long discussion in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1017 and https://github.com/dotnet/apireviews/tree/master/2015/06-09-os-version#1017-os-version-information.\r\n\r\nIt was explicitly designed to allow new platforms to come online without needing to update the struct with new members.\r\n\r\nThe property function should probably just pass the string down: \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\ninternal static bool IsOsPlatform(string platformString)\r\n{\r\n   return RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Create(platformString));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd also suggest renaming it to IsOSPlatform (upper-case S) to match with RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform().\r\n\r\nThe only quirk is that OSPlatform seem to do a case-sensitive comparison of the string, i.e. `WINDOWS` would work but `windows` won't.\r\n\r\nIt'd be quite unfortunate if MSBuild created _yet another_ slightly different API to do platform checks.\r\n\r\n/cc @cdmihai @rainersigwald ",
