  "title": "Add ability to ignore imports that are empty files",
  "body": "In certain cases when creating new imports within a UI, a file might not have any content yet.  For instance, if you create a new `Directory.Build.props` within a project, Visual Studio will immediately re-evaluate the project and since the newly created file is empty, the evaluation will fail and the project will unload.\r\n\r\nI propose a new `ProjectLoadSetting` like `IgnoreEmptyImports` that treats an empty file as an empty project.  It would also treat empty XML files as empty if they only contained the XML declaration like:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<? xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince its a new project load setting, it would be opt-in and probably only used by UIs.  I've taken a first stab at this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/compare/xplat...jeffkl:IgnoreEmptyImports?expand=1",
