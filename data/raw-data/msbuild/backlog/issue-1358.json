  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to update the Assembly Information (Title, Description, Company, etc) of a brand new .NET Core csproj, which is causing the entire Visual Studio 2017 RC IDE to crash with an unhandled exception. This happens when I try to update the values directly from the `Properties -> Application -> Assembly Information...` window as well as when I use the Properties pane when left clicking the csproj file in the Solution Explorer.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
