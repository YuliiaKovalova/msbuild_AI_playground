  "body": "We will depend on the upcoming [contentFiles feature](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/%5BSpec%5D-Content-v2-for-project.json) in NuGet to deploy files that need to go in subfolders of the MSBuild folder.\n\nTo support this, I plan to update the \"Prerelease\" version of this task in the [dotnet/buildtools](https://github.com/dotnet/buildtools) repository to understand these items in the lock file, and switch our build to use that task instead of the in-box one (we are already doing this for non-Windows builds).\n",
