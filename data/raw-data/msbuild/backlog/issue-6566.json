  "body": "context: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6552#issuecomment-861053226\r\n\r\nWe're disabling the workload resolver in the bootstrap MSBuild. It's not needed to build MSBuild itself, but it will be nice to have in future scenarios when using the just-built MSBuild to build other projects. We should turn it back on.\r\n\r\nOne possibility: don't use this convoluted bootstrap approach and instead formalize creating a private SDK with an unzipped SDK + our new binaries copied in. But I'm not tied to that.",
