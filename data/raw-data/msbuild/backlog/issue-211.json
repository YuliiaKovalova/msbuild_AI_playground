  "body": "`GetTestTaskAssemblyLocation` in [TaskRegistry_Tests.cs](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/XMakeBuildEngine/UnitTests/BackEnd/TaskRegistry_Tests.cs) _compiles an assembly from source_, instead of just building a normal DLL as part of the build and using it as a test subject.  That seems unnecessary and over-complex.  Can it be moved to a simple precompiled DLL?\n\nWhen this is done, also scrub the file for `Skip` annotations for tests.  This behavior may have been the cause of flakiness that caused the tests to be disabled.\n",
