The net35 asset is getting selected for use in a net462 project, but isn't the right choice; in fact StringTools doesn't support anything in the range `(3.5, 4.7.2)`. I don't know if it's possible to express that in the package, though, since net35 assemblies are generally binary compatible with net40 . . .",
