        "body": "@jdnichollsc That error message appears to be generated in Cordova tooling, not by MSBuild itself.\n\nSearching for the literal text of the error turns up https://www.mail-archive.com/commits@cordova.apache.org/msg25355.html, which seems to have introduced this error.  Unfortunately, I know nothing about the Cordova build process, so I'm not sure what would cause this error.\n\nI think your best bet is to contact the Cordova folks.  If they have a question about their interaction with MSBuild related to this problem, we may be able to help investigate.\n",
