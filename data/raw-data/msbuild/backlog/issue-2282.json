Or if that's the discrepancy?\r\n\r\nIs this issue aimed to extract the impl from the 2 classes?\r\nI would like to work on this issue, please advise!",

Based on tmat's comments, it sounds like you should start by extracting the C# implementation and then adopt that in the VB one.\r\n\r\nWe'd love to take a PR that addressed this. Please target the `master` branch, and let us know here if you have any questions. I'll remove the `up-for-grabs` label from this if you want to work on it.",
