Once we get msbuild satellites in CLI, we'll get bad output for text outside the ASCII range unless the user has set their console code page to 65001, which is not common and may cause them other problems.\r\n\r\nI've asked the corefx team to reconsider putting the burden on every localized command line tool for this in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/14496, but we'll not likely get that in a CoreCLR that the CLI can depend upon in VS 2017.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/5007\r\n\r\n@cdmihai",
