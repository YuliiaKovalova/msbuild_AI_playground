  "body": "### Summary\n\nI was just having a look through the release notes for [Aspires 9.0 RC1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/whats-new/dotnet-aspire-9-release-candidate-1?tabs=unix&pivots=dotnet-cli) and was happy to see that workloads have been eliminated.\n\nThank goodness! \ud83e\udd73 \n\n...but then I was reading the migration instructions and I spotted something that - while I think I know what's going on - could easily become confusing due to the level of ambiguity in terminology:\n\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n\n  <Sdk Name=\"Aspire.AppHost.Sdk\" Version=\"9.0.0-rc.1.24511.1\" />\n```\n\ud83d\ude1e\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is neat as I feel it's akin to the gradle plugin system. \ud83d\udc4f \n\nIt's just... Couldn't you guys have picked a better name than `Sdk`?  Now we have `<Project Sdk=`, which is then followed by an element called `<Sdk`.  And then to make matters worse, the values for both are namespaced.\n\nMark my word, this will be a small - but evergreen! \ud83c\udf32\u2604 - source of confusion!\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nQuality of life with naming and structure, which MS has been known to struggle with. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nI mean, even the fact that we've had to live with workloads for a period while the pains were worked out in public shows that these things warrant more consideration.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nWhat was wrong with `Plugin`?\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",

But if it really did that, then each package would need to document whether it's designed to be referenced as `PackageReference`, `Sdk`, or `Plugin`.",

        "body": "Alright, so given that the `<Sdk` and `Sdk=` are equivalent, it really just comes down to awareness that there are three ways to reference SDKs in msbuild projects.\n\nI almost wonder if it'd be good to encourage the use of `<Sdk` over `Sdk=` to help people better understand the relationship to their project and capabilities.\n\nThe only reason I suggest this is that most people are unlikely to end up at the doc above and all project templates from MS favour the `sdk=` approach.\n\nAnyway, not a huge deal, I was just curious.",
