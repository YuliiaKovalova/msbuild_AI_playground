But the `CoreResGen` target does [some gymnastics](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/4e405a802d587368581117daf3402491beea8de7/src/XMakeTasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L2785-L2809) to figure out the right architecture/runtime version to use for the `GenerateResource` task.\r\n\r\nOn .NET Core we should just use `CurrentArchitecture`/`CurrentRuntime`.\r\n\r\nOr as @nguerrera suggested, maybe just add the `DoesTaskHostExist` check for Architecture as well as Runtime.",

        "body": "Another wrinkle to this is that `TargetFrameworkAsMSBuildRuntime` [is based on](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/4e405a802d587368581117daf3402491beea8de7/src/XMakeTasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L485-L487) the `TargetFrameworkVersion`, and doesn't check the `TargetFrameworkIdentifier`.  This means that for projects targeting .NET Core 2.0 or .NET Standard 2.0, MSBuild will try to generate resources using .NET Framework 3.5.  If it's not installed, then it will fail with:\r\n\r\n> The \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.GenerateResource\" task could not be loaded from the assembly Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v3.5, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.
