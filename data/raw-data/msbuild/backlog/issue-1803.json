  "title": "Exec task \"&\" escaping is broken when 8.3 names are disabled",
  "body": "We have a few tests such as [TempPathContainsAmpersand1-4](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/e5bc7994348dba88d1f6fe2ebd6aa354355f0063/src/Tasks.UnitTests/Exec_Tests.cs#L234) that test for a specific scenario of having a `%TMP%` path with a `&` character in it. MSBuild has special logic to [escape that character](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/Tasks/Exec.cs#L604-L611) (`^&`) AND calls into `GetShortFilePath` in order to get the 8.3 version of the directory name. This seems to work around issues with `cmd.exe`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have 8.3 file system disabled (I installed a VM that inadvertently had this disabled by default) this logic fails. The call to `GetShortFilePath` returns the original path and the workaround fails. I was able to get the command to run from the command line with `cmd /c \"\"c:\\...\\foo & bar\\file.cmd\"\"` (note the double `\"\"`), but even that still caused the task to exit with an error code.",
