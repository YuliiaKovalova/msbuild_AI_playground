  "title": "[Bug]: Defining a project configuration for one project disables project negotiation for the whole solution graph",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nDefining a project configuration for one project in a solution turns off dynamic platform negotiation for all projects in the solution graph.\r\n\r\nThis is because the conditional to turn off dynamic platform negotiation is <Target Name=\"_GetProjectReferencePlatformProperties\"\r\n          Condition=\"'$(EnableDynamicPlatformResolution)' == 'true'\r\n                     and '$(CurrentSolutionConfigurationContents)' == ''\r\n                     and '@(_MSBuildProjectReferenceExistent)' != ''\">\r\n\r\n'$(CurrentSolutionConfigurationContents)' == '' turns off negotiation on to broad of a level and this should instead be done on a per project basis.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a solution that references projects outside of that solution.\r\ndefine a configuration for all projects in the solution\r\nMake sure there is a need for negotiation in the inside to outside solution reference IE x64->AnyCPU\r\nBuild said solution.\r\n\r\nthe inner to outer solution dependency will not do negotiation and therefore not build as AnyCPU\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIf a project does not have a configuration in a solution, platform negotiation should take place regardless of other projects configuration.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIf a project does not have a configuration in a solution, but other projects do, platform negotiation will not take place for the project without a configuration.\n\n### Analysis\n\n<Target Name=\"_GetProjectReferencePlatformProperties\"\r\n          Condition=\"'$(EnableDynamicPlatformResolution)' == 'true'\r\n                     and '$(CurrentSolutionConfigurationContents)' == ''\r\n                     and '@(_MSBuildProjectReferenceExistent)' != ''\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe '$(CurrentSolutionConfigurationContents)' == '' can be removed from this conditional since we already check for setplatforms on the individual project level\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

ClassLibrary1.sln  includes  project ClassLibrary1, which has solution platform configuration AnyCPU. ClassLibrary1 project references one out of solution project ClassLibrary2.   \r\n2.   Set project ClassLibrary2 platform as x64.  \r\n3.  In the binlog, didn't find the [SetPlatform Negotiation] (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/ProjectReference-Protocol.md#setplatform-negotiation) related task executed.\r\n\r\nCould you have a look if there are any differences between your repro steps and mine?",
