Create a new console app (dotnet new console)\r\n2. From the project file, delete the `sdk` definition in `<Project>`\r\n3. Try to build the project with `/graph` option\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBuild fails with `error MSB4040: There is no target in the project.`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nBuilds says it succeeded when it did not.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
