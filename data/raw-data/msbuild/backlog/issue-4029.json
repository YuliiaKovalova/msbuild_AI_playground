  "body": "I'm making a .props file that reads some properties in a .csproj and then sets other properties and loads some nugetpackages.\r\nI want to add errors or warnings when the properties are empty. So I added a warning tag that looks for a empty property.\r\n\r\nAlso I would like to add a link to a support page in visual studio. Can an url be added to this attribute.\r\n\r\nThe 1 code becomes an url in visualstudio but now points to a MDN page.\r\nIf I add a HelpKeyword attribute with an url the link in visual studio changes but not to the value of the help keyword.\r\n\r\nHow does this tag work? Can I set this tag to a specific url in visual studio?\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project InitialTargets=\"ValidateProjectParameters\">\r\n    <Target Name=\"ValidateProjectParameters\">\r\n        <Warning Text=\"The property TestProperty is empty in the projectfile\"\r\n                 Condition=\"'$(TestProperty)' == ''\"\r\n                 Code=\"1\"\r\n                 HelpKeyword=\"http://google.com\">\r\n    </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```",
