  "title": "GenerateResource does not fail when converting binary .resx resources to .txt resources",
  "body": "On the full framework, if a .resx data element points to a path and there's a type specified to read that file, the conversion of the .resx resource to a .txt resource is impossible and the tasks logs an error (since .txt resources cannot have binary values).\n\nHowever, the .net core behaviour is to write the file path to the .txt.\n\nThis happens because the full framework uses a special xml reader, ResXResourceReader , that reads a path in the .resx file directly to its specified .net object. However this special xml reader is not available in .net core, so a normal xml reader is used instead, which just reads the text file name.\n\nTests that capture failure:\n- GenerateResource_Tests.UnsupportedTextType, InvalidReference, FailedResourceReader\n\nOther implications\n- .resx binary resources with specified .net types don't work.\n\n@dsplaisted Should we copy the ResXResourceReader type to the msbuild codebase? If we try to mimic its behaviour, we end up re-implementing it.\n",

Either the contract for resgen.exe and .resx format is different for .net core, or this is a bug\n**Read from .resource** - not allowed\n\n**Write to .resx** - not allowed\n**Write to .resource** - yes, but by coercing values to string\n",
