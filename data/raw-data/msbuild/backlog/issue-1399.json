  "body": "Creating an issue to track the overall migration.\r\n\r\nOur repo should take advantage of the .NET Core project features / SDK in VS2017 and remove dependency on BuildTools as much as possible (i.e. remove `init-tools` in favor of `dotnet`).\r\n\r\nThis should include using globbing and as many features added for .NET Core projects as possible for dogfooding. We will need to adjust our source layout for all of this to work, but it should be the eventual goal.",
