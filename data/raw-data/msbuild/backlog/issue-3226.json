  "body": "Background: I have a very complicated build process, and would like to produce a *uniquely named* log file for *every* `msbuild` invocation within the build...without needing to explicitly specify a filename at each invocation.\r\n\r\nFeature request: could `LogFile` values contain *filename globs*?\r\n\r\n    msbuild /bl:LogFile=mybuild*.binlog ...\r\n\r\nWhen a glob is encountered, a *unique* filename would be created, using numbers to differentiate.\r\n\r\nThe first build would produce `mybuild1.binlog`, the second `mybuild2.binlog`, the 1000th build would produce `mybuild1000.binlog`, etc.",
