  "body": "Creating this issue to have an open discussion and get community input for our support of mono. We have made use of the `xplat` branch to support the .NET Core Framework and many features that don't work yet (or don't make sense anymore) are compiled out based on configuration. Our [roadmap](/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Roadmap) does not include any changes for mono, so we would like input on where to go from here. Some options:\n1. Create a new `xplat-mono` branch from the LKG(@f9d8cc725ca2cd46d7e01015afba0defea95ce37) and continue to maintain a fork focused on supporting mono.\n2. Continue to include support for mono in the current `xplat` branch alongside .NET Core. Currently our top priority is supporting .NET Core, so support will be somewhat limited.\n3. Others options?\n",
