  "body": "Approximately half of our Linux builds we run on Travis started recently failing with:\r\n\r\n`MSBUILD : error MSB4166: Child node \"19\" exited prematurely. Shutting down. Diagnostic information may be found in files in the temporary files directory named MSBuild_*.failure.txt.`\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a build that failed like this: https://travis-ci.org/aspnet/SignalR/jobs/238567957\r\n\r\nThe error says to look for MSBuild_*.failure.txt files in the temporary files directory but there are not there. The only files in /tmp are: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ls /tmp/*\r\n/tmp/clr-debug-pipe-3871-2510650-in   /tmp/dotnet.u9E2nmQWg\r\n/tmp/clr-debug-pipe-3871-2510650-out  /tmp/dotnet.uFJfXhhNI\r\n/tmp/dotnet.86YK7j2WA\t\t      /tmp/dotnet.XVL3GkXqg\r\n/tmp/dotnet.kn40yYkhz\t\t      /tmp/hosts_127_0_0_1\r\n/tmp/dotnet.prNGfwjzG\t\t      /tmp/hosts_sans_127_0_0_1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the /tmp directory the correct place to find the MSBuild_*.failure.txt. files? If so, the files are not there so, how can I figure out what the issue is and why MSBuild crashed?",

How to get the log files (MSBuild*failure.txt) from a CI server? #1038 covers that by logging the content to console perhaps. We also had to jump through hoops to get the log files from the CI server. So it would be good addition to have.\r\n2. How useful is the content of log files? This is what I am looking for. If by some means I retrieve the logs, is there sufficient information for me to understand the issue which caused it.\r\n\r\n> Agreed that this is hard to diagnose, but there's only so much we can do from one process when we observe that another process has crashed.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right here. I am not sure what information a process has when it crashes. But I would be happy if somehow it is indicated that process ran out of memory. It gives some direction in investigating what is going wrong.",
