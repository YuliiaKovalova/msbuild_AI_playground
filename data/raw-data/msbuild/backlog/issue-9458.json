  "title": "[Bug]: ResultsCache ignores some of the BuildRequest data, may return incorrect results",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\n`ResultsCache` ignores `BuildRequestDataFlags.ProvideProjectStateAfterBuild` and `RequestedProjectState`, which may lead to incorrect over-sharing and returning incomplete results. `BuildResult.ProjectStateAfterBuild` is used by design-time builds in Visual Studio where this issue was discovered.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe repro is provided as a private MSBuildLocator branch:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildLocator/compare/main...ladipro:MSBuildLocator:results-cache-bug\r\n\r\nBuild and run the BuilderApp project to reproduce.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild fails because the second submission returns null `ProjectStateAfterBuild` despite having constructed the build request with `BuildRequestDataFlags.ProvideProjectStateAfterBuild`.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThe two build requests appear to be treated as identical by the results cache. The cached results of the first build request are returned when the second build request is submitted.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 17.9.34322.171",

        "body": "The changes in #9565 had the side effect of making requests with `ProvideSubsetOfStateAfterBuild` not cacheable, which broke VS design-time builds. Debugging [AB#1943607](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1943607) has pinpointed this to:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/299e0514835a1588e6ef21b1da748462dec706b8/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Scheduler/Scheduler.cs#L453\r\n\r\nNote that if `TrySatisfyRequestFromCache` fails, we use `newResult.Clone()` and this instance is not going to have `_projectStateAfterBuild` set because neither `Clone` nor `BuildResult` constructors preserve the field. This may not be the only issue but it's generally what's believed to be happening in the problematic scenarios - the assumption that what we just built is in the cache is broken, and we consequently return incomplete results to VS.",
