  "body": "The .NET Framework 4.5.2 was shipped out-of-band to Visual Studio and MSBuild was never updated to resolve paths in some cases. A customer reported an issue to us with the following code example:\n\n``` C#\nvar path = ToolLocationHelper.GetPathToDotNetFrameworkReferenceAssemblies(\n                TargetDotNetFrameworkVersion.Version451);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Path to reference assemblies='{0}'\", path);\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nPath to reference assemblies='C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETFramework\\v4.5.1\\'\n```\n\nThis code fails when given `Version452`, which is a valid .NET Framework version.\n\nOne small note is there is not a .NET Framework SDK version 4.5.2, only 4.5.1.\n",
