  "title": "[Feature Request]: Add property to `ProjectRootElement` for convenient access to `<Sdk>` elements",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nProject files can contain `<Sdk>` elements (modeled by `ProjectSdkElement`).\r\nFor parity with other project contents, there should be a property to access only those elements (e.g. `SdkReferences`).\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are already properties for accessing the `Sdk` attribute, all properties, all imports and all items.\r\nHowever, while `Sdk` elements appear in `Children`, they have no dedicated convenience accessor of their own.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n/// <summary>\r\n/// Get a read-only collection of the SDK references.\r\n/// </summary>\r\npublic ICollection<ProjectSdkElement> Sdks => new ReadOnlyCollection<ProjectSdkElement>(Children.OfType<ProjectSdkElement>());\r\n```\r\n\r\n(name could also be `SdkElements` for better distinction from `Sdk`; there is also `ChooseElements`)\r\n(using `Children` and not `AllChildren` because I assume these elements are only valid at the top level)\r\n\r\nA nice-to-have additional property (`SdkReferences`) or method (`GetSdkReferences()`) would be one that gathers all SDK references in a project, from all sources:\r\n- `Sdk` attribute on the project\r\n- `Sdk` elements\r\n- `Import` elements that specify an SDK\r\n(That would make it easy for something like Dependabot to check whether a particular project references an SDK package for which an update is available.)\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n_No response_",

        "body": "Please assign this issue to me.\n\n1. There is a clear request to modify `Microsoft.Build.Construction.ProjectRootElement` to add a new `SdkElements` property. (I'm favoring `SdkElements` over `Sdks` as the name.)\n\n2. I have questions about the \"nice-to-have additional property\" that provides all SDKs. It seems like it should be on `*.Evaluation.Project` and not `*.Construction.ProjectRootElement`. An `Import` element that has both an `Sdk` attribute and a `Condition` attribute would be included only if the `Condition` evaluates to true. Does this have value? Should such a property be added or should the idea be tabled for discussion?\n\nI can start on the first item.\n\n**Update:** I have code changes for the first item ready for a PR. Because I don't want to create an unsolicited PR, I'll wait either for the issue to be assigned to me or for other feedback. Thanks",
