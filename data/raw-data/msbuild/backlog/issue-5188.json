  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n+ Install `WSL2` `Debian 10` on `Windows 10 version 2004`.\r\n+ Install `.NET Core 3.1 SDK`.\r\n+ Install `Visual Studio Code` on Windows 10 natively and connect with `Remote - WSL`.\r\n+ Install C# language support extension. \r\n+ Open a project simply generated from `dotnet new console` and wait for `OmniSharp` loading.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEverything works fine.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nA warning is reported in omnisharp log:\r\n```\r\n[warn]: OmniSharp.MSBuild.ProjectLoader\r\n        Could not write lines to file \"/tmp/.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1.AssemblyAttributes.cs\". Access to the path \"/tmp/.NETCoreApp,Version=v3.1.AssemblyAttributes.cs\" is denied.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.200\r\n Commit:    c5123d973b\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     debian\r\n OS Version:  10\r\n OS Platform: Linux\r\n RID:         debian.10-x64\r\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/3.1.200/\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.2\r\n  Commit:  916b5cba26\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.200 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.2 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.2 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS info:\r\n`Windows 10 build 19041.153` updated from `Windows Insiders Slow Ring`\r\n\r\n### Remarks\r\nI don't know in which repository this issue should be. Maybe in `wsl`, `omnisharp`, `msbuild`, `dotnet sdk`, or `mono runtime`, but I found #2188 a similar issue even though this one is probably different in the new `WSL2` environment.\r\n",
