  "title": "Make \"child node exited prematurely\" more diagnosable from CI like Jenkins",
  "body": "In a typical CI system like Jenkins only the console output and expected build logs are easily available. By the time the result is examined the VM may have even been recycled. So when a build fails this way:\n\n`error MSB4166: Child node \"4\" exited prematurely. Shutting down. Diagnostic information may be found in files in the temporary files directory named MSBuild_*.failure.txt.`\n\nThere is no easy way to diagnose the problem, so it cannot be fixed. Note that it's likely this isn't a bug in MSBuild proper - it can happen when a task runs out of stack space.\n\nSuggestion: there is no reason why MSBuild.exe can't read the content of such a file and dump it to the console before it terminates. It knows the child process's PID and when the build started (or, it could give the child process a unique ID to put in the file name, but it's not necessary to do that work). It doesn't need to be a pretty solution.\n\nHopefully in this situation everything has been drained from the child node's logging events as well, such as the last step it wsa executing.\n\nThis situation has been happening in the dotnet/corefx repo.\n",

At that point it could then look in ExceptionHandling.DebugDumpPath for any files named MSBuild_pid-*_*.failure.txt whose write time was later than the start of the build, and dump the content of those to the console.
