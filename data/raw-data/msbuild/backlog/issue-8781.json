  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI tried to add `/tl` to the build in dotnet/runtime repo. For the most part it works great - I like this.\r\nBut in some cases the \"active\" targets (the lines which are updating with times) get mangled a little bit:\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/10670590/07a58888-e34c-49b7-8c57-6404bfdb10a7)\r\n\r\nThis is on Windows, running in Windows Terminal under powershell (.NET 7 pwsh).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nRun something like:\r\n`.\\build.cmd Clr+Libs /tl` in dotnet/runtime repo.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nEach target shows exactly one time.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSome targets sometimes show the time twice (with only the second one updating)\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
