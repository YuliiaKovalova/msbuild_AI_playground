  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\n`dotnet build` does not detect deleted EmbeddedResources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download example project from https://github.com/innominateAtWork/NoRebuildWhenDeleteEmbeddedResource\r\n2. `dotnet run` it outputs all files included as EmbeddedResources in MyApp.csproj and their content\r\n3. Change the text in File1.txt\r\n4. `dotnet run` the project rebuilds and includes the updated text\r\n5.  Delete File1.txt\r\n6. `dotnet run` the project does NOT rebuild the run looks identical to the prior run\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMyApp rebuilds because an EmbeddedResources has been deleted.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nMyApp does NOT rebuild.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.11.3+0c8610977 for .NET\r\n17.11.3.35201",

        "body": "Thank you @JaynieBai! \r\n @rainersigwald the incremental build scenario is broken when one tries to delete from `EmbeddedResources`, but no other change is present. It seems like the CoreCompile target is skipped due to all outputs being newer than all inputs, which is true, but not correct. The only change since the previous build is deleted File1.txt and it is absent from inputs as well, so this change does not trigger the re-compilation of assembly. ",
