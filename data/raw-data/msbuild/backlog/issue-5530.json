  "title": "CopyOnWriteDictionary should just wrap ImmutableDictionary",
  "body": "In our tests on large solutions that have .NET Core projects in them, ProjectInstance objects used as snapshots can end up taking up to 10% of the managed heap (or more). Almost half of that is CopyOnWritePropertyDictionary<ProjectMetadataInstance> instances. (For example, a sample 1000 project solution has 300k instances.)\r\n\r\nThe current CopyOnWriteDictionary is not as efficient as ImmutableDictionary, moving it to just wrap ImmutableDictionary will create significant memory savings.",
