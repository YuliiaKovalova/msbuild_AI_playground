We're also happy for the help text to be updated in the xplat branch either way.\n",

Additional code needs to be added to check if the \"bad\" switch is in fact a file path. Your case (when a file path happens to be a valid switch) is less likely and may not be of concern as there is no easy way to handle this anyway.\n",
