Unfortunately it's not easy to fix.\nThis is the runtimes project.json: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/targets/runtimeDependencies/project.json\n\nStaring at the lock file, the problem happens because of the following shared dependency between net46 and .netstandard1.3: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/targets/runtimeDependencies/project.json#L10\nIn our XPLAT branch which restores just fine, we depended on `\"xunit.netcore.extensions\": \"1.0.0-prerelease-00116\"` , which in turn depended on `\"System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation\": \"4.0.0-beta-23213\"`\nNow that I bumped up xunit.netcore.extensions, it brings down a version of `System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation` that is not happy anymore.\n\nHonestly I do not understand why it even works on the XPLAT branch. I guess the ideal option going forward here is to have xunit.netcore.extensions also target net46, right? Or make without the dependency.\n",
