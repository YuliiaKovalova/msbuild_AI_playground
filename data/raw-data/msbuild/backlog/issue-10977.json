  "body": "###  Contaxt\nIdea formulated by @vzarytovskii \nDuring collection of diags for VS feedback issues, we collect traces and other helpful info. We should think about producing and attaching binlogs (DTB + Build) as well.\n\n### Notes\n* We might want to circle-buffer remove older logs to get just the reasonably sized most recent logs\n* This should be easy for user induced \"provide feedback\" action. Do we want to plug ourselves in other scenarios as well? (perfWatson, perf labs etc.)",
