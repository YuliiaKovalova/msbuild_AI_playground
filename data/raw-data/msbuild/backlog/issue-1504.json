  "body": "The .NET CLI ships the .NET Core version of MSBuild, not the mono version. This means that MSBuild does not understand the redirects in the mono FrameworkLists if building a netXY targeted project under the .NET CLI preview 4 even if setting TargetFrameworkRootPath. Can this be changed so that desktop frameowrk builds become a reality when using mono's assemblies as reference assemblies?",
