  "body": "Looks like https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/2557 caused a regression with some exclude code paths we have in corefx. See https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/24534 for one change I've needed to work around this issue (I've since hit numerous other places that are affected).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the repro:\r\n```\r\n_NETStandardRefFolder = D:\\git\\corefx\\packages/netstandard.library\\2.0.1\\build\\netstandard2.0\\ref\r\n_excludeForNetFx contains multiple items but for my example it contains mscorlib\r\n\r\n<_netstandardShimAssemblies Include=\"$(_NETStandardRefFolder)\\*.dll\" Exclude=\"@(_excludeForNetFx->'$(_NETStandardRefFolder)\\%(Identity).dll')\" />\r\n\r\nAfter that statement is executing _netstandardShimAssemblies contains:\r\nD:\\git\\corefx\\packages\\netstandard.library\\2.0.1\\build\\netstandard2.0\\ref\\mscorlib.dll\r\n\r\nBut the Exclude contains:\r\nD:\\git\\corefx\\packages/netstandard.library\\2.0.1\\build\\netstandard2.0\\ref\\mscorlib.dll\r\n```\r\nNotice the difference in slash after packages directory. \r\n\r\nThat code used to work but doesn't any longer. Given both the wildcard and the Exclude expressions both use the same property I would expect this to work. ",
