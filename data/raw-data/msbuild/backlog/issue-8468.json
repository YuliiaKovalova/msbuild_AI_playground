Can `NetCurrent` be backported to a version of Arcade that we can adopt without requiring .NET SDK 8 preview releases, letting it toggle between net7 for normal operation and net8 for 8 sourcebuild? We don't want to be on an alpha SDK to ship (for example) 17.6 LTS bits.",

        "body": "I had typed out a big response and then I figured out what you were saying. The key bit here is that the arcade in use is overridden in product source build. So if we backported the properties and msbuild references `NetCurrent`, then the behavior looks like the following:\r\n\r\n| Branch | Official build | Repo-level source build | Product source build |\r\n| -------- |--------|------|------|\r\n| 17.4 (7.0.100) | net6 | net6 | net7 |\r\n| 17.5 (7.0.200) | net6 | net6 | net7 |\r\n| 17.6 (8.0.100/7.0.300) | net6 | net6 | net8 |\r\n\r\nIt's subtle because the TFM will flip automatically based on the use of the newer arcade in product level source-build.\r\n\r\n@MichaelSimons How does repo-level source build determine what SDK to use? Is it just what is in `global.json`? If that's the case, then there is no way for msbuild to target net8 in source build unless they don't test it in repo-level source build.",
