  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\n - .NET 6.0.200 SDK no longer produces ref assemblies in the bin directory when ProduceReferenceAssembly is set to true.\r\n - .NET 6.0.101 SDK works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n - Install .NET 6.0.200 SDK (took latest build from dotnet/installer). dotnet --info ` Version:  6.0.200 Commit:  e950d07146`\r\n - dotnet new classlib -o RefAssemblyTest\r\n - cd RefAssemblyTest\r\n - Open RefAssemblyTest.csproj and add `<ProduceReferenceAssembly>True</ProduceReferenceAssembly>` to the main property group.\r\n - dotnet build\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n - bin/Debug/net6.0/ref directory exists with reference assembly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n - No bin/Debug/net6.0/ref directory.\r\n - The obj/Debug/net6.0/ directory has a ref and a refint directory.\r\n - Works with .NET 6.0.101 sdk.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets uses 'refint' instead of 'ref' which I think is causing the problem. Typo?.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/91c64cef6ae8a45dbc7387ef78f298708ce92fca/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L397\r\n   <IntermediateRefAssembly Include=\"$(IntermediateOutputPath)refint\\$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)\" Condition=\"'@(IntermediateRefAssembly)' == ''\" />\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0.101 sdk does not create a refint directory anywhere.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\ndotnet --info\r\nVersion:  6.0.200\r\nCommit:  e950d07146\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n",

        "body": "This is an intentional change (see dotnet/msbuild#6543)--can you describe what you were doing with the ref assembly before? There may be a better way to reference it that is robust to path changes.\r\n\r\nWe got many complaints about the `bin/ref/` folder after its introduction and the build speedups can work fine without it. If you would like to control the path, you can set the property `TargetRefPath` to a path of your choosing.\r\n\r\n@baronfel we probably need an SEO'ed document on this change.",

        "body": "I was investigating an internal devdiv bug 1464647 filed against VS Mac. A classic Xamarin.iOS project is referencing a netstandard project that generates a reference assembly using ProduceReferenceAssembly. The build here seems to fail with an error:\r\n\r\nerror CS0006: Metadata file 'FormsRefAssemblyRepro/FormsRefAssemblyRepro/FormsRefAssemblyRepro/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/ref/FormsRefAssemblyRepro.dll' could not be found\r\n\r\nIf not copying the assembly to the bin/framework/ref directory is by design then I suspect this may be a problem on the VS Mac side since it is not possible to build a classic Xamarin.iOS project with dotnet's msbuild, so we have two different msbuild's being used in the same solution. The non-dotnet msbuild I suspect is assuming the old behaviour and failing.",
