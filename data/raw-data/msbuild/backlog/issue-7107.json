  "title": "Allow to share ProjectElementRootCache between ProjectCollection",
  "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThis is a feature improvement/request. A `ProjectCollection` is creating internally a `ProjectRootElementCache` instance, but when working on a build server, we need to have a way to share the same cache for all `ProjectCollection` configurations that we need to create. Today, it's impossible to achieve this without hacking into through `System.Reflection` to share the cache.\r\n\r\nHow could we best bring this feature?\r\n\r\nCould we add a constructor to `ProjectCollection` that would take another `ProjectCollection` to reuse the same `ProjectRootElementCache` ?\r\n\r\nSomething like this by adding a `ProjectCollection sharedCache = null` last parameter?\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic ProjectCollection(IDictionary<string, string> globalProperties,\r\n                            IEnumerable<ILogger> loggers,\r\n                            IEnumerable<ForwardingLoggerRecord> remoteLoggers,\r\n                            ToolsetDefinitionLocations toolsetDefinitionLocations,\r\n                            int maxNodeCount,\r\n                            bool onlyLogCriticalEvents,\r\n                            bool loadProjectsReadOnly,\r\n                            ProjectCollection sharedCache = null)\r\n{\r\n    // \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc: @KirillOsenkov",

        "body": "> Can you elaborate on this a bit please? I don't think I object to the idea in theory but I'm not sure I understand the use case.\r\n\r\nLet's say that for example a server receive a request to build Release, and then Debug, I would like to maintain a state of e.g ProjectCollections that would use the same cache for the XML projects loaded (because they are identical). So for example:\r\n\r\n- 1 ProjectCollection for Release\r\n- 1 ProjectCollection for Debug\r\n\r\nBoth pointing to the same underlying `ProjectRootElementCache`.\r\n\r\nLater, this project collection are used to propagate the cache to BuildParameters (with the `BuildParameter(ProjectCollection)` [constructor](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/9bcc06cbe19ae2482ab18eab90a82fd079b26897/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildParameters.cs#L231))\r\n\r\nwhile retrieved internally in BuildParameters here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/9bcc06cbe19ae2482ab18eab90a82fd079b26897/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildParameters.cs#L914\r\n\r\n\r\nbut with the existing API, it's not possible to maintain different ProjectCollection concurrently in memory that could share the same `ProjectRootElementCache`, so I assume that all XML msbuild files are going to be deserialized multiple times.\r\n\r\nHence why I would like to have a way to share this cache across these ProjectCollection instances.",
