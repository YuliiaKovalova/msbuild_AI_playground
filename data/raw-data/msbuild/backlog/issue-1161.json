  "title": "On a machine with VS \"15\" installed, we should find the VS Toolset",
  "body": "Historically, MSBuild was in the GAC and toolsets were located via the registry. This meant that an application that used MSBuild APIs a) didn't have to ship MSBuild assemblies and b) could load and build any project that worked in VS, because MSBuild found the installed toolset.\n\nThis is no longer the case with Visual Studio \"15\". Now MSBuild doesn't have a registry impact and isn't necessarily in a known path. That means that even if you ship `Microsoft.Build.dll`, you must _also_ ship a full copy of tasks and targets--and there's no way of knowing what \"full\" means, since VSIXes can deliver arbitrary targets.\n\nIdeally, an MSBuild caller could get access to the VS toolset for free.\n",
