  "title": "[Bug]: MSB4184 while evaluating an expression in property setter",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nEvaluating certain expressions causes `MSB4184`.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a regression from .NET 7 to .NET 8.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project InitialTargets=\"Test\">\r\n\r\n  <Target Name=\"Test\" >\r\n\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n      <Foo>Foo</Foo>\r\n\r\n      <!-- This has to be numeric. -->\r\n      <Bar>1234</Bar>\r\n\r\n      <!-- This is a workaround. -->\r\n      <Good>$([System.String]::Equals($(Foo), $(Bar)))</Good>\r\n\r\n      <!-- This works on .NET 7 but on 8 it doesn't. -->\r\n      <Bad>$(Foo.Equals($(Bar)))</Bad>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe expression to evaluate.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFor the given sample above I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4184: The expression \"\"Foo\".Equals(1234)\" cannot be evaluated. The input string 'Foo' was not in a correct format.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is from my CI when I encountered this the first time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4184: The expression \"\"\".Equals(2852592)\" cannot be evaluated. The input string '' was not in a correct format.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThe second operand (`Bar` in the example) needs to (most likely) be a number for this problem to appear.\r\n\r\nAlso converting to `$([System.String]::Equals(...))` mitigates the problem.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n- My current MSBuild version: `17.11.0.32015`\r\n- MSBuild version from my .NET 7 build container: `17.7.6.17813`\r\n- MSBuild version from my .NET 8 build container: `17.11.4.40609`",
