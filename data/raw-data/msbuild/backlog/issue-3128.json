  "title": "MSBuild should define a mechanism for injecting transformations",
  "body": "We need a stable method for binary re-writing tools to inject themselves to the build process, so that the files built during compilation can be post-processed before being copied to the output directory.\r\n\r\nAn example for this is the [IL-Linker](https://github.com/mono/linker), which runs ILLinker/Crossgen on MSIL files generated during a build.\r\n\r\nThe transformations should \r\n* Inject themselves transparently to the rest of the build process (ex: via a package-include)\r\n* Be able to run continuously during a development cycle and preserve incremental compilation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne method of achieving this in ILLinker.targets and other places is to capture the `IntermediateAssembly`, perform the transformation on it, and [rewrite it](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/39560549290237b27a196672d779519e61c5dd54/corebuild/integration/ILLink.Tasks/ILLink.CrossGen.targets#L36-L42).\r\n\r\nThis pattern seems one of the better design choices, wrt simplicity and preserving incremental builds. However, the problem with this approach is that certain definitions statically capture the value of `IntermediateAssembly`, thus ignoring downstream modifications. For example:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/f72bd2eaa37476819ab7647f63d445df8055dab6/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L5472-L5479 \r\n\r\n* https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/f72bd2eaa37476819ab7647f63d445df8055dab6/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L391-L393 \r\n\r\nThis will cause other tools that use the pre-captured definitions to behave incorrectly.\r\n\r\nOne way to mitigate this problem is to maintain the invariant that `IntermediateAssembly` is not captured by any MSBuild definition, and that it is only read/modified within targets.",
