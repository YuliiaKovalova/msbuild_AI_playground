Create an empty file in the project directory named **System.dll**\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nThe project builds successfully, and ignores the empty file which was not part of the project.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nMSB3246: Resolved file has a bad image, no metadata, or is otherwise inaccessible. Could not load file or assembly 'System.dll' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows 10\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc): Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.3 Preview 2\r\n",
