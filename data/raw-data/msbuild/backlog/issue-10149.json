  "title": "[Bug]: Inconsistent behavior when using Choose element for conditional package references in MSBuild",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThere is an observed inconsistency in MSBuild when attempting to conditionally include NuGet package references using the `Choose` element with the `When` condition. Specifically, using `Choose` for this purpose does not work as expected, whereas using the `Condition` attribute directly on `ItemGroup` functions correctly.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a new .NET project.\r\n\r\n2. Create a Directory.Build.props file in the root directory.\r\n\r\n3. Add the following content to the Directory.Build.props file using the `Choose` element:\r\n```\r\n<Project>\r\n  <Choose>\r\n    <When Condition=\"'$(IsTestProject)' == 'true'\">\r\n      <ItemGroup>\r\n        <PackageReference Include=\"xunit\" Version=\"2.4.1\" />\r\n      </ItemGroup>\r\n    </When>\r\n  </Choose>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Mark the project as a test project by setting the `IsTestProject` property to true in its .csproj file:\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n5. Run `dotnet restore` and observe that the xunit package is not included.\r\n\r\n6. Modify the Directory.Build.props to use the `Condition` attribute directly on `ItemGroup`:\r\n```\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(IsTestProject)' == 'true'\">\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"xunit\" Version=\"2.4.1\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run `dotnet restore` again and observe that the xunit package is now included.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBoth the `Choose` element with `When` conditions and the `Condition` attribute on `ItemGroup` should enable or disable the inclusion of NuGet package references based on the specified condition.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n- Using the `Choose` element with `When` condition does not reliably include the specified NuGet package reference when the condition evaluates to `true`.\r\n- Using the `Condition` attribute directly on `ItemGroup` successfully includes the specified NuGet package reference when the condition evaluates to `true`.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n17.9.8.16306",

        "body": "What's happening here is that the Choose condition evaluation happens only in the properties evaluation pass (pass 1), at which time the condition isn't true--`Directory.Build.props` is imported before the body of the project, so `IsTestProject` hasn't been set yet when the condition evaluates.\r\n\r\nItemGroup evaluation happens later (in pass 3), after all properties (from all imports) have been set, so your step-6 condition evaluates to the value you expect.\r\n\r\nI was a bit surprised by this Choose condition timing, and it doesn't seem to be well documented outside this comment which doesn't help anyone:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/e8d6beba65caeb5ad18e4d1f90c5487e1fabb470/src/Build/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L1492-L1497",

        "body": "Hi @rainersigwald,\r\nIf I understand correctly, the observed behaviour is by design. Which would be quite logical if project related files are interpreted in multiple passes and the `Choose` block is only evaluated once. The current behaviour is therefore quite obscure, and I would rather avoid its usage altogether.\r\nWould it be an option to modify the behaviour of the `Choose` block so it is evaluated in each pass?",
