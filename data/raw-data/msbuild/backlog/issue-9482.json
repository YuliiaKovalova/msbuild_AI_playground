  "title": "[Bug]: -version message doesn't have a line ending",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe -version switch displays the version number but doesn't include a line ending.\r\n\r\nWith Windows cmd and with PowerShell, this doesn't matter. The line is ended and the next prompt is shown on a new line.\r\n\r\nBut it shows up on macOS and Linux in a shell other than pwsh.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a nit but it is also a bit ugly and low effort to fix.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nOn macOS or Linux in a standard shell run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet msbuild --version -nologo\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpected behavior is no artifacts and the next prompt is on a new line.\r\n\r\nAn example for the bash shell:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet msbuild --version -nologo\r\n17.8.3.51904\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nzsh should be the same, except the default zsh prompt is `%`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIn bash on Ubuntu in WSL in Windows Terminal, the `$` command prompt for the next command is on the same line as the version output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet msbuild --version -nologo\r\n17.8.3.51904$\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot Linux bash](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/1728516/53f23fea-bea2-4b2f-8d50-c1e2c27f783c)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn zsh on macOS in Terminal, an inverse+bold `%` is displayed at the end of the version output (which is a zsh feature to show a partial line).\r\n\r\n```\r\n% dotnet msbuild --version -nologo\r\n17.8.3.51904%\r\n%\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1135\" alt=\"Screenshot macOS zsh\" src=\"https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/1728516/aafc795c-ec08-4aa3-bb5a-1daadc8d030c\">\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nIn the `MSBuildApp` class, the -version switch is mapped to a call to the `ShowVersion()` method.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/d8283be045c16620c3e2ae3bfe33367257c3b4f3/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L2497-L2502\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/d8283be045c16620c3e2ae3bfe33367257c3b4f3/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L4488-L4494\r\n\r\nCurrently this is the only usage of `ShowVersion()`. The `Write` could be changed to a `Writeln`.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
