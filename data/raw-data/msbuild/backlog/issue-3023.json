  "body": "I'm not sure if the build instructions are wrong or not, but they are certainly unclear.\r\n\r\nThe instructions just say:\r\n\"Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild.git\r\nBuild on the command line: cibuild.cmd --target Full --scope Compile --bootstrap-only\"\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm tired but there is a build.cmd in the top level directory and a cibuild.cmd in the build directory. \r\n\r\nThe instructions don't mention navigating to the build directory, so the next natural thing to do is look at the top level directory, and in there a build.cmd exists, which I think can confuse other developers as it did me.",

Would you be interested in doing something like that? Unfortunately, it's not a super high priority for the core team at the moment, so it'll take a while before we get to it on our own.",
