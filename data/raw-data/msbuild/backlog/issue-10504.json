  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a breaking change introduced in .NET SDK starting from version 8.0.300:\r\nDuring the evaluation stage of the build many NuGet-related properties are no longer populated, for example `$(NugetPackageRoot)` or `$(NuGetPackageFolder)` are missing.\r\n\r\nFor example when the same project is build using `dotnet build -bl` the following NuGet* properties are present in Evaluation stage:  \r\nWith SDK 8.0.206:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef5afe0-e9d7-4463-9106-248d56ddd5b4)\r\n\r\nWhile with SDK 8.0.303 only:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b87edd8-ef81-4ef9-9426-4f8c832527bc)\r\n(note missing `$(NugetPackageRoot)`)\r\n\r\nI could not find any relevant information regarding this breaking change (our build is broken since we were relying on `$(NugetPackageRoot)` being set) in [release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-6.10#breaking-changes) so I was wondering if it is undocumented change or a bug? And if there is a way to restore a previous behavior with SDK 8.0.303?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThe following minimal project demonstrates the change in behavior:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <Target Name=\"CheckProperty\" BeforeTargets=\"Restore\">\r\n    <Message Text=\"NugetPackageRoot: $(NugetPackageRoot)\" Importance=\"high\" />\r\n  </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen built using `dotnet build` command from SDK 8.0.206 the following output is produced:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ dotnet build\r\nMSBuild version 17.9.8+610b4d3b5 for .NET\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  NugetPackageRoot: /home/eduard/.nuget/packages/\r\n  Restored /home/eduard/codeir/ir-grpc/src/Test/Test.csproj (in 78 ms).\r\n  Test -> /home/eduard/codeir/ir-grpc/src/Test/bin/Debug/net8.0/Test.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same output is expected under SDK 8.0.300.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen built using `dotnet build` command from SDK 8.0.300:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ dotnet build\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  NugetPackageRoot:\r\n  All projects are up-to-date for restore.\r\n  Test -> /home/eduard/codeir/ir-grpc/src/Test/bin/Debug/net8.0/Test.dll\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\n\r\nIs it undocumented change or a bug? And if there is a way to restore a previous behavior with SDK 8.0.303?",
