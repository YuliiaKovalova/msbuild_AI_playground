  "title": "[Bug]: Internal MSBuild Error: Targets cannot be reset once set.",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nHello MSBuild Team! As you may know Rider uses MSBuild API to load and build projects. Some time ago we faced a new issue with project loading:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Framework.InternalErrorException: MSB0001: Internal MSBuild Error: Targets cannot be reset once set.\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.Shared.ErrorUtilities.ThrowInternalError(String message, Exception innerException, Object[] args)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.BuildRequestConfiguration.set_ProjectTargets(HashSet`1 value)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.BuildRequestConfiguration.SetProjectBasedState(ProjectInstance project)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.BuildRequestConfiguration.set_Project(Pro[1936226.TestSolution.msbuild-task.zip](1936226.TestSolution.msbuild-task.zip)jectInstance value)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager.CreateConfiguration(Project project, BuildRequestConfiguration existingConfiguration)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.ConfigCache.GetMatchingConfiguration(ConfigurationMetadata configMetadata, ConfigCreateCallback callback, Boolean loadProject)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager.GetProjectInstanceForBuild(Project project)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get this exception from time to time (but very seldom) when Rider has to load lots of tiny projects on solution opening. Our code looks like this simplified example:\r\n```\r\nvar buildManager = new BuildManager();\r\nvar projectCollection = new ProjectCollection();\r\nvar context = EvaluationContext.Create(EvaluationContext.SharingPolicy.Shared);\r\n\r\nParallel.ForEach(paths, new ParallelOptions { MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4}, path => {\r\n\r\nvar xml = ProjectRootElement.Open(path, projectCollection, preserveFormatting: true);\r\nvar project = Project.FromProjectRootElement(xml, new ProjectOptions\r\n        {\r\n          GlobalProperties = ...,\r\n          ProjectCollection = projectCollection,\r\n          LoadSettings = ...,\r\n          EvaluationContext = context \r\n        });\r\nvar projectInstance = buildManager.GetProjectInstanceForBuild(project); // Exception here\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis starts to happening on Linux in this SDK: `dotnet-sdk-8.0.100-linux-x64-c4c95f56`\r\nLooks like something was changed inside `ProjectInstance` creating and not it is not thread-safe anymore?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nWe don't have exact steps now. But it is not obvious what was broken in the last SDK we can try to make a repro.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nno exception\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nexception\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\ndotnet-sdk-8.0.100-linux-x64-c4c95f56",

Thanks for your help with the investigation. It's actually the same project we use in tests which I have pasted above in the issue. There is nothing specific except of having 300 synthetic library projects all of which target net8.0. And problem appears while loading some of them once in a while. Loading is done as per that code snippet above.\r\nThat should help reproducing the issue. Please, let us know if further details are needed. Cheers!",

So that we can try to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nHere the project is the one that has the code snippet above loading the test projects. It helps to understand if necessary props and targets files from SDK are imported correctly.\r\n",
