        "body": "@sibber5 The [version comparison functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/property-functions?view=vs-2022#msbuild-version-comparison-functions), including `VersionLessThan()`, accept two strings that represent either a [four-part version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.version?view=net-9.0) or a semver. The functions don't know what package, if any, that the strings may be related to. Determining \"the latest version that matches the wildcard\" is outside of these functions.\n\nAre you invoking the `VersionLessThan()` function in your own custom MSBuild code or is this function invoked by MSBuild code within the Aspire Sdk? If the latter, i.e. referencing the SDK using a wildcard creates a problem, that may be an issue to file against the Aspire SDK.",
