  "title": "[Broken Build]: Project-to-project references not copying local",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI have a mixed C#/C++ solution. I am currently in the process of rewriting the codebase to use a more modern MSBuild setup (I last worked on this project three years ago, and I know a lot more about MSBuild now than I did then).\r\n\r\nPlease see the binlog attached below.\r\n\r\nThe project `librevenge` references `zlibd1.dll` from vcpkg. This DLL is copied into the OutDir and added (AFAICT) to the appropriate MSBuild item to have it copied into the OutDir of downstream projects. The project `libwpd` references `librevenge`. I want the two DLLs from librevenge to be copied into the OutDir for libwpd. This does not occur. I then have a dummy C# application (since I have not yet finished updating the real one) that references `libwpd`, and I want to copy files from `libwpd` in the same way. This does not occur either. I have tried every permutation of MSBuild syntax I can think of with the project references to make MSBuild perform the above copy operations.\r\n\r\nNote that C++/CLI is _not_ being used.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n[Here is the zipped binlog](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/11223226/msbuild.binlog.zip).\r\n\r\nI am building using `msbuild.exe /p:Platform=x64 /p:Configuration=Debug /bl`.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1. The files `zlibd1.dll` and `librevenge.dll` should be copied into the OutDir for the `libwpd` project.\r\n2. Those two files, plus `libwpd.dll`, should be copied into the OutputPath for the `CopyTest` project.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNone of the above files are copied. This will cause my app to break at runtime due to missing DLLs.\n\n### Ask us questions\n\nI have also tried adding a custom MSBuild target in the C# project that manually adds deployable content from the vcxproj into the C# project as Content items. (In the above binlog, this target does nothing, because I have not been able to determine which targets I should use to call to get the list of files to copy.) Should csproj/vcxproj together not do this intrinsically, what is the best way to implement this?",

Works great.",
