  "title": "[BinFmt] Opt-in warn on Custom BuildEventArgs usage",
  "body": "### Background \r\n #6215\r\n This subitem is focused on FullFw usages of custom BuildEventArgs. \r\n Custom BuildEventArgs currently uses BinaryFormatter for de/serialization: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Shared/LogMessagePacketBase.cs#L377 This is going to be resolved for Core as in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/8823. The fixing PR introduces warning for Core in case the Custome BuildEventArgs are attempted to be serialized ([here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8917/files#diff-39cbfa4c8cd24d6a641a794b405985440b851ee5ff3ba29c98af486227e79b39R576) and [here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8917/files#diff-3a587e2c61ef7a0a5acd5967ea75a73570a65c0267b0e3d5879344d7bad6bbe0R1162)). In order to allow easier depart of Custom BuildEventArgs for FullFw builds - we want to introduce opt-in mechanism issuing same warnings.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n Same warnings as introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8917 (see links above for precise location) can be opted-in for FullFw build\r\n\r\n### Suggested approach\r\nDefine global property that will enable #ifdefed code introduced in the mentioned PR.\r\nCreate FullFW unit test verifying the warning is issued",
