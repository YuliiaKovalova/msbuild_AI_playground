  "body": "I have a situation to build multiple solution using MSBUILD in multi threading, but during build, always few solution get failed. I have try to build each soutoin one by one , its working perfectly. but i have try to build 5 solution using multi threading, few build get failed. As I investigated the build log file of both success build and failur build, it seems MSBUILD getting conflict with each build process. For reference I have attached two text file of build log. \r\n\r\n![first](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29802243/27746176-cc319718-5de3-11e7-8868-9bcab3856957.png)\r\n\r\n![second](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29802243/27746185-d6d38f82-5de3-11e7-8514-1f04c1a3bd20.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n[11468 success.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1115978/11468.success.txt)\r\n\r\n[11468 failed.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1115979/11468.failed.txt)\r\n",

In any case, since this hasn't seen any action in years, we may have resolved it accidentally. Are you still hitting this problem?",
