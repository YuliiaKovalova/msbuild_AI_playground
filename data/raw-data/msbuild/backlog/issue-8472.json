In their CI/CD script's they'll generate an unique tag for the image by using some other program (for example the `date` command available in most unix systems) and then they'll use the value of that as part of a `-property:ContainerImageTag={{ env.DATE }}` kind of variable interpolation inside of GitHub actions.\r\n\r\nThis is attractive to me for that reason, but I agree with collecting more user use cases.",
