You can see remnants of that ifdefed out now:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/48874c3f3d5e29dbecf30be33a7cd00bffde1038/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L696-L705\r\n\r\nResurrecting eventing by adding events at those same points would be a good first start, but there's probably room for even more eventing.",

The nice thing is then to be able to collect all tooling events in a single queryable stream, that makes it easier to diagnose build problems.",
