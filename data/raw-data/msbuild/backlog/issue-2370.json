  "title": "DispatchToInnerBuilds does not support matrix builds on Platforms",
  "body": "Currently `DispatchToInnerBuilds` only supports building multiple outputs based on `$(TargetFrameworks)`, some projects, e.g. [Microsoft/perfview](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview) would benefit from the ability to have the build matrix leverage other aspects (in this case `$(Platforms)`, as requested in the comments in Microsoft/perfview#319). I was able to implement this manually by overriding `DispatchToInnerBuilds` (see https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview/pull/319/commits/c7e54d556763ff6065e034a0d0f9c7bc98658350):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"DispatchToInnerBuilds\" Returns=\"@(InnerOutput)\">\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n      <_TargetPlatform Include=\"$(Platforms)\" />\r\n      <_TargetFramework Include=\"$(TargetFrameworks)\" Platform=\"%(_TargetPlatform.Identity)\" />\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n    <MSBuild Projects=\"$(MSBuildProjectFile)\"\r\n             Condition=\"'$(TargetFrameworks)' != ''\"\r\n             Targets=\"$(InnerTargets)\"\r\n             Properties=\"TargetFramework=%(_TargetFramework.Identity);Platform=%(Platform)\">\r\n      <Output ItemName=\"InnerOutput\" TaskParameter=\"TargetOutputs\" />\r\n    </MSBuild>\r\n  </Target>\r\n```",
