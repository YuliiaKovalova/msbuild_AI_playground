  "body": "So API users can expand msbuild globs or regex match them just like the engine does.\r\n\r\nAPI reqs and specs:\r\n- [x] Globs should match against strings (matching is what CPS actually needs, and what triggered the creation of these APIs)\r\n- [ ] Globs should be able to expand files on disk. Issue tracked separately: #1908\r\n- [x] Globs should be composites\r\n- [x] Glob matching should be path aware (\"../a.cs\" should not match a against \"**/*.cs\")",

I have opened a separate issue with your idea: #1876 \r\n\r\nRegarding negative globs, you can still express their intent via Exclude attributes and Remove elements. Though negative globs would indeed be shorter to express.",
