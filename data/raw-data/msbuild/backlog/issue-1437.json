So the current output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!--<Import Project=\"SomeProject\" Condition=\" '(SomeProperty)' == 'true' And Exists('SomeProject') \" />-->\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it would instead say:\r\n```xml\r\n<!--\r\n<Import Project=\"SomeProject\" Condition=\" '(SomeProperty)' == 'true' And Exists('SomeProject') \" />\r\n Not imported because the condition evaluated to \" '' == 'true' And false \"\r\n-->\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould that suffice?  Putting it in the logger output would be very noisy and we think using the preprocessor is better for troubleshooting missing imports.",
