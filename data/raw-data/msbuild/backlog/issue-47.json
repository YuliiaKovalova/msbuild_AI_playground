  "body": "MSBuild does not currently offer any way to pass-through properties to the projects within a .sln file.\n\n[Despite the documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx), properties provided at the command line with a solution file are ignored. \n\nThis makes it very difficult to disable XML warnings on a CI server in order to reduce output noise. Many developers feel that 30% of their lines of code should not be  `/// <summary>`, and that code noise (like output noise) must be justified .\n",
