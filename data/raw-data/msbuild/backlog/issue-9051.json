  "title": "[BinFmt] Usage of  BinaryFormatter in tests",
  "body": "During migrating to new arcade using dotnet8 we have encounter few errors related to usage of deprecated `BinaryFormatter`,\r\n\r\nIt seems we are using BinFmt in some tests:\r\n\r\n- `AssemblyNameEx_Tests` - we probably do no longer need binaryformatting of AssemblyNameEx\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/a9034a279cdb9f31166fa1212439822e6b2fbf56/src/Framework.UnitTests/EventArgs_Tests.cs#L56-L68 \r\nwhidbey seems to be VS2005 - I don't think we need it anymore, if VS still uses it they shall fix it soon - we don't need test for it\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/a9034a279cdb9f31166fa1212439822e6b2fbf56/src/Framework.UnitTests/LoggerException_Tests.cs#L49-L57\r\nI thing this has been addressed in recent Jan changes in `SerializationContractInitializer` and we do no longer need to BinFmt LoggerException and whole `LoggerExceptionTests` class can be deleted\r\n\r\nNOTE: @JanKrivanek FYI",
