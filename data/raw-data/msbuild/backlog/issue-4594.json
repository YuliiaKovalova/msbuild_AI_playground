  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In VS2017, create a Class Library called Library1 (C# .net framework 4.0)\r\n2. Use Packages.config format to consume a nuget package **microsoft.bcl.async**  1.0.168 version\r\n3. In default Class1.cs file I have content:\r\n```c#\r\npublic class Class1\r\n    {\r\n        static void TestMethod1()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Have a nice day\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.Then I create a new empty web site(C# .net framework 4.0), right-click the web-site to add reference to Library1, now right-click the solution=>rebuild the solution everything works well.\r\n\r\nThe Library rebuilds successfully, and the website successfully copy the latest Library1.dll to bin folder and PreCompile folder.\r\n\r\n5.Now if I add some async methods into the Library1. The rebuild in VS works well with no warnings.  code:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic class Class1\r\n    {\r\n        static void TestMethod1()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Have a nice day\");\r\n        }\r\n        static async Task F() => await TaskEx.Delay(100);\r\n        static void TestMethod2() => F().Wait();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nSince the rebuilding solution in VS works well, now I want the msbuild command-line also works so that I can automate managing it.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nHowever if now I use msbuild command-line, open developer command prompt for VS2017 and navigate to solution folder(cd path), use command: **msbuild xxx.sln /t:rebuild** it throw warnings like:\r\n```\r\n(Rebuild target) ->\r\n  C:\\Users\\xxx\\source\\repos\\Library\\WebSite1_1_.metaproj : warning MSB3268: The primary reference \"C:\\Users\\lancel\\s\r\nource\\repos\\Library\\Library\\bin\\Debug\\Library.dll\" could not be resolved because it has an indirect dependency on the f\r\nramework assembly \"System.Runtime, Version=1.5.11.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" which could not\r\nbe resolved in the currently targeted framework. \".NETFramework,Version=v4.0\". To resolve this problem, either remove t\r\nhe reference \"C:\\Users\\xxxx\\source\\repos\\Library\\Library\\bin\\Debug\\Library.dll\" or retarget your application to a fra\r\nmework version which contains \"System.Runtime, Version=1.5.11.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd exactly the Library1.dll is not the latest one. Simple code in Library1.dll and the msbuild command-line works well and website will copy the latest Library1.dll. Async code in library1's class1.cs, and then the msbuild command-line won't work as I expected.\r\n\r\nWhat confused me:\r\n\r\nAs it always works well when building in VS, so actually I try to make it still work in msbuild command-line, but I failed to do that. It only works when I use devenv.exe instead of msbuild.exe. Any hint would be appreciated!",
