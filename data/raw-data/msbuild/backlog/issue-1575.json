        "body": "Hashed based incrementality would surely be slower than just copying the file. Instead of read+write you read+hash+read+hash+write. Plus you're doing it yourself instead of calling OS directly to copy. Might as well just copy always.\r\n\r\nThe question in my mind is how did the file get changed without the timestamp changing? Source control changes it. Editing changes it. Timestamps work for makefiles.\r\n\r\nIncidentally I think Copy goes a little further and checks size as well.\r\n\r\nThe only other option is to enable hardlinks. Which is great until you hit a world of file locking pain :)",
