  "title": "Path problem on Mono when building solution files",
  "body": "The solution files in Visual Studio (both on Windows and Mac) use '\\\\' as directory separator when referencing the project files. It however breaks when trying to build specific projects in a solution using msbuild.\r\n\r\nI've created an empty project in Visual Studio for Mac -\r\n[HelloWorld.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/828485/HelloWorld.zip). Now the following command results in no project being built:\r\n\r\n> msbuild HelloWorld.sln /p:Platform=x86 /t:HelloWorld\r\n\r\nIn case it affects the build somehow I should mention that we use MSBuildEmitSolution=1 environment variable.\r\n\r\nEnabling diagnostics shows the following message:\r\n\r\n> Task \"MSBuild\" skipped, due to false condition; ('%(ProjectReference.Identity)' == '/Users/filipnavara/Projects/HelloWorld/HelloWorld\\HelloWorld.csproj') was evaluated as ('/Users/filipnavara/Projects/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj' == '/Users/filipnavara/Projects/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj').\r\n\r\nAs you can clearly see the error message is wrong too. The expanded condition doesn't match what is actually being evaluated. Running under debugger shows that the left-hand side of the comparison was evaluated as '/Users/filipnavara/Projects/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.csproj.metaproj' and the right hand one as '/Users/filipnavara/Projects/HelloWorld/HelloWorld\\HelloWorld.csproj' (ie. the string wasn't processed by the expanding function, while in the debug message it was).",
