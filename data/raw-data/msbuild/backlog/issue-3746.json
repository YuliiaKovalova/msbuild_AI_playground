  "body": "If you attempt to use a .winmd with an implementation DLL in native ARM64, you get an error like\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnknown processor architecture. The implementation file \"whatever.dll\" for \"whatever.winmd\" had an ImageFileMachine value of \"0xAA64\". If you wish to use this implementation file make sure the \"ResolveAssemblyWarnOrErrorOnTargetArchitectureMismatch\" property in your project is set to \"Warning\" or \"None\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should add to the list of known architectures here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/3b3c3ea645cc529120c762cf2a8504ff960f7fb2/src/Tasks/AssemblyDependency/ReferenceTable.cs#L2773-L2794\r\n\r\nNote: there's no corresponding entry in SystemProcessorArchitecture, so implementation may not be totally trivial.",
