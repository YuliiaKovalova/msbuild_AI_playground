  "body": "The ProjectGuid tag is pretty important in the MSBuild Ecosystem and as the name suggests should not be duplicated.\r\n\r\nHowever I am unable to find documentation that describes just exactly how this is used.\r\n\r\nAt very least I know it is used when you create a ProjectReference Tag (and is documented here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items?view=vs-2017#projectreference) and when you create a Solution File in Visual Studio (the Project Guid is extracted and then kept in the SLN file) that is not as well documented but you see some inklings here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.workspace.extensions.msbuild.projectinsolution.projectguid?view=visualstudiosdk-2017).\r\n\r\nCan someone point me in the right direction? If its not documented, who should I forward a request to?",

It is still present in the solution.\r\n\r\nWe have several tools that generate solution files due our our deep dependency tree (3,500+ MSBuild Project System Style Files) which would be impossible to maintain via the tooling (at least in any consistent manner). If this Guid is gone how does Visual Studio determine the Guid to Insert in the Solution? Much of the tooling blasts away any existing Solution File and regenerates from the N-Order Dependencies (as that is the safest thing to do) but because the solution file format is idempotent we can pretty safely perform this operation and not get a bunch of Version Control File Modified issues.\r\n\r\nWhile I have your attention, is there any supported Solution API? We've rolled just about everything by hand and used the lightly documented [Solution Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.workspace.extensions.msbuild.solutionfile?view=visualstudiosdk-2017) which probably means we are doing something wrong.",

In SDK-based projects, the solution is the only thing that is aware of the project GUID - there was no need to duplicate it in the project.
