Which packages are the right ones to reference for task authors.\r\n2. Which packages are more or less \"internal implementation details\" (`Runtime`) and what you should use instead (MSBuildLocator).\r\n\r\nAfter we get a draft out we should see if we can get some of @ghogen's time for editing.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/introducing-the-new-nuget-org-package-details-page/",
