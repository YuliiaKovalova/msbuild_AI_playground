Loading and Parsing\r\nMSBuild loads and parses the project file( reads the XML & builds an internal representation of nodes)\r\n\r\n2. Property and Item Evaluation\r\nProperties are values that can be referenced throughout the project file, and items are sets of related items (files, references, etc.). \r\n\r\n3. Importing and Expanding Imports:\r\nProcesses <Import> elements, bringing in additional project files. \r\n\r\n4. Condition Evaluation:\r\nEvaluates conditions associated with various elements in the project file, such as targets, tasks, properties, and items.\r\n\r\n5. Target Graph Construction:\r\nThis graph represents the order in which targets should be executed. \r\n\r\nIt looks like that we need to track the origin for some inputs for targets/tasks.\r\n\r\n",
