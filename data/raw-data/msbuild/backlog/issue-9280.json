  "title": "[Bug]: Error output of `dotnet restore` while `/tl` is on does not show errors",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThis is what the output looks like when there's a problem during `dotnet restore`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nD:\\repos\\arcade-services> dotnet restore\r\n\r\nRestore failed in 4,9s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem in this case was a duplicate entry in `Directory.Packages.props`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Take any repo that is using CPM (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/central-package-management)\r\n2. Duplicate an entry in the `Directory.Packages.props` file (or make another NuGet configuration mistake such as forgetting to add an item for a package used in a project)\r\n3. Call `dotnet restore`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nErrors that show without `/tl` should show with `/tl` on so that it's possible to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nNo errors are shown.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.8.0-preview-23418-03+0125fc9fb for .NET\r\n17.8.0.41803",
