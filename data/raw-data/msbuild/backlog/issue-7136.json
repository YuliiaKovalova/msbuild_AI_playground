  "body": "https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6876 added some events to SDK resolution but more are needed to determine how many times and SDK resolver was called and if caching resolutions is being used or not.  We also need events around the main node handling requests and the out-of-proc node sending requests.\r\n\r\nLet's add more events:\r\n- [ ] An SDK request happens on the main node but was already cached\r\n- [ ] An SDK request happens on an out-of-proc node and was not cached\r\n- [ ] An SDK request happens on an out-of-proc node and was already cached\r\n\r\n**Question**:  Should we allow SDK resolvers to contribute to these events?  It might be helpful for them to break down their timing so we know what's taking so long. We would need to provide something via the `SdkResolverContext`.\r\n",
