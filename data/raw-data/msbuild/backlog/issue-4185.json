  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThree people updated their Visual Studio 2017 to 15.9 and all three got different MSBuild versions:\r\n\r\n15.9.28307.280 or .344 or .423\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nWe experience problems with all versions but .423 (i.e., tests using Roslyn fail unexpectedly). Is this to be expected?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNo problems when creating the MSBuildWorkspace in our Roslyn tests.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output: 15.9.28307.XXX\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows 10\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc): VS 2017 15.9\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the newest version of MSBuild with the highest revision number?",
