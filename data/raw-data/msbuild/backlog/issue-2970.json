  "title": "Add a master switch for copy type (actual copy, hard links, symlinks)",
  "body": "Currently there is no single gesture for the user to specify the copy behaviour across the entire build. Targets use custom properties to control their Copy task behaviour (e.g. `CreateHardLinksForCopyAdditionalFilesIfPossible `, `CreateSymbolicLinksForCopyFilesToOutputDirectoryIfPossible`, etc). This makes it hard for third party copying tasks to know what to do. Should they add their own custom property? Should they scan `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets` and OR all the linking properties they find?\r\n\r\nImplementation variants:\r\n- add a command line switch `/linking:<none>|<hardlink>|<symlink>` which gets exposed to tasks via IBuildEngine.\r\n  - cons: tasks that already have custom linking properties now have to reconcile their inputs with a potential IBuildEngine.LinkType\r\n- add a plain old property in `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets` to act as the master switch\r\n  - cons: only available to builds that are based on `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets`",

(CSPack seems to have other problems, too).",
