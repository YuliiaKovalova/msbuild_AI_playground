My workaround is adding \"/p:NuGetPackagesDirectory=$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\\Packages\" to the msbuild arguments.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find this anywhere on GitHub and it took me a while to see the suggestion of adding that argument on StackOverflow, so I thought I would go ahead and create a ticket here. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
