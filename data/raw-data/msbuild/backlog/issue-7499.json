  "title": "Add RegexOptions.CultureInvariant to regexes",
  "body": "As per discussion in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7498, all regexes used in MSBuild should have RegexOptions.CultureInvariant unless they are expected to behave differently in different cultures (and I suspect none are). #7498 fixes the only case known to be causing a problem.\r\n\r\nthis one probably could cause a problem, but I guess nobody reported it:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/058a0262c6b37fba7bb55ec03315232d5d83be6e/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L1806\r\n\r\nthis one and all the others in this file should have it most likely\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/c34eb484f1ddf0f9e1940c620b1eff169433f5a1/src/Shared/CanonicalError.cs#L55\r\n\r\nThis will also give a very small perf improvement, at least until .NET 7.\r\n\r\nThere may be others. Running all the MSBuild tests with the OS set to tr-TR may find one.",

But I do think ideally all regex would have CultureInvariant (probably even if they don't have IgnoreCase, although it wouldn't matter in that case, unless the pattern had `(?i)` in) just for clarity, in the same way our string comparisons are always Invariant/InvariantIgnoreCase, unless we explicitly want culture dependent behaviour\r\n\r\ncc @rainersigwald ",
