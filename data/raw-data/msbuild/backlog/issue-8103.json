  "body": "Recently I ran the VS experimental insertion on a build without optimization data and the DDRITs did not fail. \r\nWe would like to measure the effect OptProf has on MSBuild performance. If it is too small, we would like to consider dropping the collection and usage of optimization data. Talk about the results with performance teams.",
