  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10508 made it possible to properly distinguish if just some loggers requests evaluation data (expresse via `IEventSource4.IncludeEvaluationPropertiesAndItems`). However if this is not called the data are still included on `ProjectStartedEventArgs` - this is required to support older loggers (which expected the data on ProjectStartedEventArgs).\r\n\r\nSo we can end up in one of the situations:\r\n* Data are included in EvaluationFinishedEventArgs (if all loggers explicitly opted in)\r\n* Data are included in ProjectStartedEventArgs (if none logger opted in)\r\n* Data are included in both events (if we have mix of above)\r\n\r\nBut there is currently no way to indicate that no eval data are needed.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\n* Intoduce IEventSource5 and on it a method/property to indicate no eval data are needed (e.g. `ExcludeEvaluationPropertiesAndItems`)\r\n* Call this from `SimpleErrorLogger`, `BaseConsoleLogger` (depending on verbosity level), `TerminalLogger` (unless it leverages the eval data  which might happen soon)\r\n* Expose the method on `MuxLogger` and inform [users of MuxLogger](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_search?text=muxlogger*&type=code&pageSize=25&filters=ProjectFilters%7BDevDiv%7DRepositoryFilters%7BAnyCode*CPS*VS%7D&action=contents&result=DefaultCollection/DevDiv/CPS/GBmain//src/Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Implementation/Build/IndependentBuildManagerHost.cs) about the existence of this\r\n* `SimpleErrorLogger` should as well set `OnlyLogCriticalEvents`",
