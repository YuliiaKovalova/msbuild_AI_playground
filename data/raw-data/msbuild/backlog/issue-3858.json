  "body": "I'm making a .props file that reads some properties in a .csproj and then sets other properties and loads some nugetpackages.\r\nI want to add errors or warnings when the properties are empty. So I added a warning tag that looks for a empty property.\r\nBut I got an error that the warning tag can no longer be placed directly into the project tag. So I added an target tag and placed the warning tag into the target tag.\r\nAnd to make sure the properties are always checked I have added the target to the the InitialTargets attribute in the Project tag. Is this the correct way, or will I now override the InitialTargets attribute in the csproj file.\r\nAlso I would like to add a link to a support page in visual studio. I used the HelpKeyword attribute but visual seems to mangle the url. Can an url be added to this attribute.\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project InitialTargets=\"ValidateProjectParameters\">\r\n    <Target Name=\"ValidateProjectParameters\">\r\n        <Warning Text=\"The property TestProperty is empty in the projectfile\"\r\n                 Condition=\"'$(TestProperty)' == ''\"\r\n                 Code=\"1\"\r\n                 HelpKeyword=\"http://bfy.tw/19ge\"/>\r\n    </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```",

        "body": "That's a pretty good way to do this. `InitialTargets` are additive (PR to mention this in the docs: MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs#1737) so you won't be clobbering anything.\r\n\r\nOne consideration: projects are built in several contexts that aren't normal builds. Most important is probably Visual Studio's \"design-time build\" which is used to extract information about the project to drive IntelliSense and other IDE features. You should be careful to only _fail_ design-time builds in very broken circumstances. Since this target emits a warning, rather than an error, it's fine.\r\n\r\nAs a general guideline, please provide a more specific error code than `1`. Users can suppress warnings using the code, so it should ideally be unique to your project. This is often done with 3- or 4-letter prefixes (like MSBuild's `MSBxxxx` or C#'s `CS1234`).\r\n\r\nWould you mind opening a separate bug about the `HelpKeyword`? Someone would need to dig into that a bit to figure out what's mangling the URL and whether that's intentional.",
