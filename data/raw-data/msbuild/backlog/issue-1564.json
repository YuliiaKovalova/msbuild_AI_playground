  "title": "When trying to make hardlinks, Copy task emits lot of unnecessary high importance messages when hardlink creation fails.",
  "body": "In latest released Visual Studio (2015), if you create UWP app packages for the store, Build output window is filled in with bunch of messages about failing to create hardlinks (expected, because those files are originating in Windows Installer-protected folders). Those are neither errors or warnings (because Copy falls back to regular copy, and everything is fine).\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n\r\n1) Create a UWP C# app;\r\n2) Project > Store > Create app packages for the store.\r\n \r\nEXPECTED: \r\n\r\n3) Build succeeds without confusing messages in output window.\r\n\r\nACTUAL:\r\n\r\n3) Build succeeds without errors or warnings in error list, but output window contains several messages about inability to use hardlinks:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1>  Could not use a link to copy \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows Kits\\10\\ExtensionSDKs\\Microsoft.NET.CoreRuntime\\1.1\\.\\AppX\\ARM\\Microsoft.NET.CoreRuntime.1.1.appx\" to \"C:\\Projects\\App1\\AppPackages\\App1_1.0.1.0_Debug_Test\\Dependencies\\ARM\\Microsoft.NET.CoreRuntime.1.1.appx\". Copying the file instead. Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED))\r\n\r\nI have found that this is a regression from September, from commit [Merge copy task support for symlinks into xplat](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/commit/5fda85e683b1ef93b867716395890eb8bab268c0), which changed verbosity of those messages from Normal to HighImportance.\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR to revert those back to Normal importance.\r\n",
