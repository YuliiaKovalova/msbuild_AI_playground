  "title": "[Bug]: Cross Targeting Rebuild target is not extensible",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhen rebuilding a project for multiple TFMs, the `RebuildDependsOn` property group is ignored and there is no way to extend the Rebuild process for each inner project since it ends up running `Clean;Build` for each of them. Also, there is not way to know those targets are executed in a Rebuild \"context\".\r\n\r\nThis makes rebuilds behave differently than for a single TFM, that can be extended through the `RebuildDependsOn`.\r\n- Cross Targeting Rebuild: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/c6e6cd447ac3944b351247d995f32b4d2010d409/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CrossTargeting.targets#L163\r\n- Single Target Rebuild: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/c6e6cd447ac3944b351247d995f32b4d2010d409/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L979-L983\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic from Visual Studio, where the Rebuild project command of a project targeting multiple TFMs will always execute Rebuild for all of them by calling the Cross Targeting Rebuild target.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a .NET project targeting multiple frameworks (i.e., MAUI or a console app targeting .NET 6 and 7)\r\n2. Add an extra target to the `RebuildDependsOn` property group\r\n3. Rebuild the project from Visual Studio or from .NET CLI without a specific target framework\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nYour target should be executed.\r\n\r\nIf `RebuildDependsOn` is not available for the outer project, at least there should be a way to extend Rebuild in that scenario or a property that can signal that the Clean and Build targets are executed as part of a Rebuild. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nYour target is not executed\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
