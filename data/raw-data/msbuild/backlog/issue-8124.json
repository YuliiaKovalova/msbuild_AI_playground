  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy team is looking into using the `Microsoft.Build` NuGet package (mostly the `Microsoft.Build.Construction` namespace) to potentially replace one of our internal libraries.\r\n\r\nI see in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/Construction/ProjectRootElement.cs#L40 that \"Comments and whitespace cannot be edited through this model at present.\" I suppose this is true for its `abstract` ancestor `ProjectElement`. It would be great if I can programmatically add comments to certain elements in project files.\r\n1. Is your team actively working on supporting comments? If not, is there a timeline for this feature?\r\n2. Is the feature open for community contributions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",

You can use a combination of the XML object model and the Construction object model, or you may be interested in the `Label` attribute, which is [available on all `ProjectElement`-derived classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.build.construction.projectelement.label?view=msbuild-17-netcore) and can be used for your own purposes (MSBuild itself preserves but does not respect `Label`).",

        "body": "@rainersigwald is there a way to get at the `XmlElement` associated with an item or property? Seems like that information exists but is stored in internal properties only. If there's a way to perform that linkage through the public APIs, then that would be a good workaround.\r\n\r\nGoot to know about `Label` as well!",
