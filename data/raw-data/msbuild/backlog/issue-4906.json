  "body": "There seems to be a problem with nodemode (an internal flag) without an argument.\r\nI set MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART to 1 and built a project that referenced two other libraries using the command:\r\n`<path to MSBuild.exe> <path to project file> /m /nodemode /nodereuse:false`\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: useful error message about how nodemode works.\r\nActual behavior: unexpected bug with a message asking me to file a bug on GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis should not be an important issue because is has minimal customer impact, but it still might be nice to have a better error message.",
