  "body": "Right now, it seems the only way to invoke unit test projects via the test platform is to use `dotnet test` on the project file. The problem is that forces the CoreCLR version of the Build tasks and not all tasks work on CoreCLR.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nhttps://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET/blob/f339ba7c0821d00f9c0cb29186c97713765a6d03/Rx.NET/Source/Tests.System.Reactive/Tests.System.Reactive.csproj\r\n\r\nI cannot simply run `dotnet test` on that because the\u00a0GitVersionTask is .NET Desktop only. That's fine for building, but I\u00a0then need a way to\u00a0invoke the test platform once per target\u00a0framework with the right parameters.\r\n\r\nIt should do whatever dotnet test is...I think it's going to vstest.console /Framework: ... with the supported frameworks.\r\n\r\nIt seems\u00a0that `Microsoft.TestPlatform.targets` is in the\u00a0CLI build but not in the main SDK. It should be in the main SDK for use with msbuild.",
