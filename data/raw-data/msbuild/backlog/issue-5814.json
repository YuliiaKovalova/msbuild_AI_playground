  "title": "XmlPoke should accept an empty value",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nNot providing a value to the `Value` property of the `XmlPoke` task results in the following error message:\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4044: The \"XmlPoke\" task was not given a value for the required parameter \"Value\".\r\n```\r\nThe simple reason is that the `Value` property is marked with `[Required]`. However, this behavior prevents the task from being able to set values to empty strings. There are valid use cases where XML elements, attributes, etc. need to be set to empty strings. I don't mean removing elements, attributes, etc. I truly mean setting them to empty strings.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n`Value` should not be a mandatory property. Not providing a value to it should set the targeted entity to an empty value.\r\n",
