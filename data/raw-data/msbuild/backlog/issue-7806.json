  "body": "Since the .NET 6 SDK's ``ImplicitUsings`` was added for global usings support for C# projects. I am filing this issue here for my work on an pull request to change that.\r\n\r\nNote: The PR still needs some changes to msbuild files to make it all work since I made a new parameter (ironically it's named ``ImplicitUsings``) as required (might be a slight breaking change that can be reviewed to make it less breaking).\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of how breaking this might be, It might not be possible to put it in any .NET 6 servicing releases (for now).",

        "body": "What's the benefit of changing this? It seems to make things less reliable, by assuming that the referenced namespaces are in @(Using) if implicit usings are enabled.\n\nI think it would be more useful to make the generated assembly attributes more robust against any ambiguity caused by implicit usings, by making the task use CodeTypeReferenceOptions.GlobalReference if requested via some metadata, and then making the .NET SDK request that when it adds items to @(AssemblyAttributes).",
