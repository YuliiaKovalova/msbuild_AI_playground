  "body": "### Summary\n\nThis property only has two documented values, \"Windows_NT\" and \"Unix\", but this doesn't tell the story accurately today. In addition, this property like all properties can be overridden by environment variables. We should guide users to better-supported mechanisms for determining the OS of the executing build. Users should use the static members of the `System.OperatingSystem` like `IsWindows()` to check platform support.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nWe don't have documented guidance for moving away from `$(OS)`, this should help drive that as well.\n\n### Sample issue or antipattern that the check should be flagging\n\nThis\r\n\r\n```\r\n      <DotNetHostFileName>dotnet</DotNetHostFileName>\r\n      <DotNetHostFileName Condition=\"'$(OS)' == 'Windows_NT'\">dotnet.exe</DotNetHostFileName>\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould suggest using \r\n\r\n```\r\n      <DotNetHostFileName>dotnet</DotNetHostFileName>\r\n      <DotNetHostFileName Condition=\"$([System.OperatingSystem]::IsWindows())\">dotnet.exe</DotNetHostFileName>\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead\n\n### Sample output\n\n_No response_",
