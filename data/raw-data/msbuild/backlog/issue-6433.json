  "title": "CMake created VS solution foldername conflicts with project/solution name",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nIf your cmake has `set_target_properties(${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTIES FOLDER \"{NAME}\")` line, it creates a project folder in the solution list. However, the folder name must not be the same as any project's or solution's name. Otherwise it will cause ` Solution file error MSB5004: The solution file has two projects named \"xxxx\"`. For example your solution is named \"GoodWork.sln\", and in your cmake script, you have `set_target_properties(${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTIES FOLDER \"GoodWork/Test\")` in any of the CMakeLists.txt, you will see this error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nBuild correctly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nError  Solution file error MSB5004: The solution file has two projects named \"xxxx\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nIt won't be a problem if you open the solution with VS and build it there. This project only occur using MSBuild in command line. So that factors out the issue from cmake.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.9.21+g9802d43bc3 for .NET Framework\r\n\r\n\r\n",
