  "body": "Since MSBuild is moving out in the open, it won't benefit from the internal VS localized builds anymore.\n\nOur localized build will:\n- [x] use XLIFF to store localized resources\n- [x] keep .resx and .xlf files in sync during localized builds. We're doing this with [XliffParser](https://github.com/fmuecke/XliffParser)\n- [ ] use satellite assemblies instead of the VS proprietary localization scheme\n\nProcess to update .xlf files: for now, we'll ping the internal localization team 2-3 weeks before a VS release to update our .xlf files, and they'll follow with PR. Ideally, eventually, they might start scanning MS GH repos.\n\nProcess for OSS contributions to translations:\n1. Contributor sends PR\n2. Internal localization team is pinged to review the PR\n3. Internal loc team reviews and signs off\n4. We merge in the PR\n\nFor now we'll do localized builds only for the Full Framework, desktop MSBuild.\n",
