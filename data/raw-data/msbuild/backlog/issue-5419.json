MSBuild is built as a .NET Core 2.1 application, but the .NET Core SDK deploys it as a .NET Core 3.0 application (in the 3.0 SDK), which updates some metadata in the `.deps.json` file indicating that `MSBuild.dll` can be run on the current runtime.\r\n\r\nAre you really updating only `MSBuild.dll`? That won't get you a valid set of binaries; you need to update all of the MSBuild assemblies.\r\n\r\nCan you clarify what you're trying to accomplish here, by updating an old preview SDK with a private build of an old MSBuild?",
