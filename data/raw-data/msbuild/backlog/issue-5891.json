  "body": "Thought of this while looking at [AB#1247204](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/0bdbc590-a062-4c3f-b0f6-9383f67865ee/_workitems/edit/1247204).\r\n\r\nWhen a child node crashes, we get a message like\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u201cChild node \u201c7\u201d exited prematurely. Shutting down. Diagnostic information may be found in files in \u201cC:\\Users\\someone\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\u201d and will be named MSBuild_*.failure.txt.\u201d.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe naming pattern for those files includes the PID but not the logical node number. It'd be nice if the PID was included in the message so you could jump right to the file in question.",
