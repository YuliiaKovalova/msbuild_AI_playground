  "title": "BuildXL nuget repo deletion breaks building older releases",
  "body": "The BuildXL nuget repo was recently deleted. This broke source-build (eg https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/4634) which was easily fixed. \n\nHowever, this also broke online builds of *older* versions of .NET, which all require fixing some way or the other.\n\nFor example:\n\n- I wanted to rebuild 9.0 RC 1 with a custom fix to re-bootstrap 9.0 RC 2. But RC 1 is broken due to missing BuildXL repo and can't be fixed (due to being a point-in-time release)\n- Someone on my team is trying to test an older commit of .NET 8 - 8.0 RC 1 specifically - to see if it reproduces a bug. But the 8.0 build is broken because BuildXL is removed.\n\nI know that, in general, expecting older releases to build out of the box is not realistic. Many bugs, tooling support and compatibility fixes are missing in older releases. However, this change accidentally breaks *all* older releases.\n",
