  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThis was on an internal Mariner deployment. The message is access denied eg \r\n```\r\n...../dotnet/7.0.401/sdk/7.0.401/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets(267,5): error MSB3027: Could not copy \"obj/Release/net7.0/DOTNET_7_APP.dll\" to \"/home/site/wwwroot/DOTNET_7_APP.dll\". Exceeded retry count of 10. Failed.  [/tmp/8dbb9829ae9e326/DOTNET_7_APP.csproj]\r\n```\r\nbegan in 7.0.400 and `MSBUILDDISABLEFEATURESFROMVERSION=17.8` is confirmed to make it go away.\r\n\r\nBelow is @rainersigwald theory \r\n\r\n> I don't mean to keep the theory a secret. In 17.7, we\r\n[changed the MSBuild Copy task](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/0809a23b75e6907fc2240aafb013f3a4578a9ada)\r\nto delete the destination file before overwriting it, because (when it was a link) we would sometimes write\r\nthrough\r\nthe link, corrupting a file in (for example) the NuGet cache. I'm wondering if it's the\r\ndelete\r\nthat's failing here, when overwriting would be fine. Setting that env var will disable that change (and others, so it's not a go-to-prod solution)\r\n\r\nWe don't know why the overwrite was working but the delete isn't, and can get traces.\r\n\r\nWe need to get some fix into RC2. Perhaps reverting the copy task at least for Linux?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n_No response_",
