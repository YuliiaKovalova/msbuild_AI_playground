  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI've posted over here; https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Performance-Build-Regression-1745-vs-1/10289641 but I think this is a problem specific to msbuild.\r\n\r\nWe are using:-\r\n\r\n17.4.1+9a89d02ff (fast, rolled out everywhere)\r\n17.5.0-preview-23061-01+040e2a90e (slow, rolled out on a few machines to test)\r\n\r\nBut I wanted to get some pointers on how to debug/diagnose this sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n> We are just rolling out 17.5.0 and we\u2019ve noticed a pretty huge discrepancy in the performance of building.\r\n>\r\n> For testing we are using dotnet new console as test project.\r\n>\r\n> dotnet clean && dotnet build --force --no-incremental -bl:17.4.5.binlog on a machine with 17.4.5.\r\n>\r\n> dotnet clean && dotnet build --force --no-incremental -bl:17.5.0.binlog on a machine with 17.5.0.\r\n>\r\n> In the small example above the difference is only 200ms or so, but in real world production projects we are seeing 45 seconds -> 200+ seconds.\r\n>\r\n> Happy to provide any further information required.\r\n>\r\n> Cheers,\r\n> Indy\r\n\r\nI've attached the binlog files. But other than everything taking a tad longer, I'm not super sure where to begin.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIndy\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n[17.4.5.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/10818305/17.4.5.zip)\r\n[17.5.0.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/10818306/17.5.0.zip)\r\n\n\n### Data\n\n[17.4.5.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/10818305/17.4.5.zip)\r\n[17.5.0.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/10818306/17.5.0.zip)\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_\n\n### Regression\n\n- [X] yes\n- [ ] no\n\n### Regression Details\n\n_No response_",
