  "body": "When I set the \"BuildParameters.LogTaskInputs\", I get the TaskInput-Events... (doesn't matter if I'm calling IEventSource3.IncludeTaskInputs\" or not).\n\nOn the other side, when I don't set \"BuildParameters.LogTaskInputs\", I don't get the TaskInput-Events (also not after calling IEventSource3.IncludeTaskInputs).\n\nI'm calling IncludeTaskInputs from my Initialize-function of my logger. And I'm currently using the MSBuild version that shipped with the latest VS 2019.\n\nMy question is, if that's supposed to work like this. Because in the case it is, I don't understand the idea behind this function.\n\n_Originally posted by @meirumeiru in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/discussions/8248#discussioncomment-4431354_\n    ",
