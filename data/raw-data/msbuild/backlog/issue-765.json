  "body": "This issue exacerbates #764 by changing a failure into a hang.\n\nSince the \"failure to load\" message gets logged by the main MSBuild.exe, it looks like the failure is getting sent over IPC correctly. But then the parent MSBuild hangs forever [in `TaskHostTask.Execute`](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/da283a7bea8a023c47cea73630fa3126c57b49a1/src/XMakeBuildEngine/Instance/TaskFactories/TaskHostTask.cs#L289), while the task host node is just sitting waiting for work.\n\nMaybe the prior `HandlePacket` that got a failure didn't correctly set `taskFinished`?\n",
