  "body": "Deliver the MSBUILD server requirements:\r\n\r\n1. **_Server behavior_**: MSBuild is capable of running its scheduler and the \"in-proc\" node in a persistent server process. The process implements a communication mechanism to be able to accept build requests from other processes and return console logging.\r\n1. **_Client behavior_**: The .NET CLI implements a communication mechanism to send build requests to MSBuild server instead of loading `Microsoft.Build` into the CLI process.\r\n1. **_Full console fidelity_**: Console output of the client is indistinguishable from the current behavior.\r\n1. **_Configurability_**: It is possible to opt out of the new behavior in case it causes unexpected issues.\r\n1. **_Performance_**: The feature results in a significant speed up of the CLI inner loop. Incremental build of a simple ASP.NET Core app is at least 3x faster.\r\n\r\nChild tasks:\r\n\r\n- [x] [Design client-server communication protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7370)\r\n- [x] [Implement a new nodetype for the server process](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7371)\r\n- [x] [Implement communication protocol in server](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7372)\r\n- [x] [Implement communication protocol in the client library](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7374)\r\n- [x] [Introduce a client-side activation/communication library](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7373)\r\n- [x] [Cover MSBuild server with tests](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7377)\r\n- [ ] [Consume the client library in dotnet CLI](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7375)\r\n- [x] [MSBuild Server instrumentation](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7496)\r\n- [x] [Memory Leak with MSBuild Server](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7639)\r\n- [x] [Investigate MSBuild Server for memory leaks.](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7646)\r\n- [x] [MSBUILD Server: cancellation.](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7647)\r\n- [x] [MSBuild server needs to know Client Console configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7658)\r\n- [x] [Make MSBuild client API experimental](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/7684)\r\n\r\n## estimates\r\n- 2 weeks for client work\r\n- 2 for server work\r\n- 3 weeks for remaining things\r\n- 2 weeks buffer",
