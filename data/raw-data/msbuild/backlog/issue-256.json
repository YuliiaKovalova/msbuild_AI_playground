  "body": "As [noted](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/254#discussion_r41272476) by @rainersigwald, the version number (14.1) is currently encoded in the path and project file for `Microsoft.Common.props`.  Ideally this number should be defined once and used to generate the right path, as well as version numbers such as `MSBuildConstats.CurrentProductVersion`, the assembly versions, and the assembly versions used in `Microsoft.Common.tasks` or other build files.\n",
