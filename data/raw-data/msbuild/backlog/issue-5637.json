I had some difficulty with reproducing the problem, though. Here's what I tried:\r\nI created a new vcxproj and replaced its content with the project you provided.\r\nI used MSBuild 16.7.0.37604 (full framework) to build the project, but that worked (not too surprising)\r\nI used Core MSBuild 16.7.0.36003 to try to build the project and reset VCTargetsPath to point to the relevant folder, but it still failed for an unrelated reason\u2014failing to find Platform.props. What did I do wrong?\r\n\r\nAlso, given that the error message is NETSDK1114, I have a feeling this is a dotnet/sdk problem. Is that correct, @wli3/@dsplaisted?",
