  "body": "Importing a target/props file multiple times causes a MSB4011 warning. The only mechanism to avoid it is to condition the import to happen only when some property is empty. This places the burden on the importer, and cannot be done for transitive imports.\n\nI propose that a mechanism is added for project files to suppress this warning:\n\n```\n<Project DefaultTargets=\"Build\" ToolsVersion=\"15.0\" IgnoreMultipleImport=\"true\">\n```\n",
