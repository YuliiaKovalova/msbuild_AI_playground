  "title": "Proposal: add OptionalTargets property to Target",
  "body": "It would be useful to be able to avoid an error when a target depends on another target that does not exist.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L745-L749\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project InitialTargets=\"T2\">\r\n  <Target Name=\"T1\" />\r\n  <Target Name=\"T2\" DependsOnTargets=\"T0;T1\" OptionalTargets=\"T0\">\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would execute `T1`, `T2` and ignore `T0` that doesn't exist. If `T0` existed it would be also executed.\r\n\r\nCurrently the workaround is to define a property that's set to `true`, usually in the file that defines the optional target and then factor the target T2 so that a condition testing that property can be used to ignore the missing target.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the same could be achieved by implementing `TargetExists(TargetName)` built-in function.\r\n",
