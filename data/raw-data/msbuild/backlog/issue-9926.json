  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThere are some existing extensibility that users might want to deliver via nugets:\r\n * loggers\r\n * tasks\r\n * sdks/sdkresolvers\r\n\r\nThere are talks on possible future extensibility that might want to be delivered via nugets:\r\n * BuildCheck / Analyzers\r\n * Project Archetypes\r\n\r\nSome of those can already be delivered via nugets, some are complex or near impossible to achieve\r\n\r\n### Sample usage scenarios:\r\n* Engineering teams wanting to run builds with custom loggers - this currently requires standalone setup step (to have the logger locally available in known location)\r\n* Custom BuildCheck packages that would require early evaluation access or a initial build access (solution processing etc.)\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n *  Ability to reference versioned nuget packages from commandline (injecting loggers, global BuidChecks etc.)\r\n * Ability to reference nugets within projects (sdks, bildchecks, tasks) and have those resolved during the restore phase and have some metadata available as input into other build phases - so that magic nuget properties or naming doesn't have to be used.\r\n\r\n### Goals of initial investigation\r\n* Summarize the scenarios and their requirements\r\n* Define if/what support from nuget side would simplify the scnearios - and negotiate creation of workitem(s) with nuget team\r\n* Propose and prototype solutions without additional nuget support.",
