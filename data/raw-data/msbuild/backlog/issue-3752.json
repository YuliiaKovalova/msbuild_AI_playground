  "body": "Traverse the graph reading the `ProjectReferenceTargets` items for each project to determine the target list to use for each project.\r\n\r\nSimplified rules:\r\n* User-provided targets is used for the entry project (or if not provided, evaluate the default targets for that project)\r\n* For each entry target in a project, check for a `ProjectReferenceTargets` item with that target name. If one exists, the Targets metadata should be added to the target list of all project references\r\n* If a project is referenced by multiple projects, the target lists are concatenated in an arbitrary, but deterministic way. Target lists maintain order within the list as well.\r\n* For entry targets without a mapping, assume they don't propagate to project references in any way\r\n* Expand the special `<default>` target as the default targets for a project (likely need to decide on a better syntax) for prior to looking up `ProjectReferenceTargets` items\r\n\r\nSee spec for details.",
