  "body": "This is from gitter chat in Mono: https://gitter.im/mono/mono\r\n\r\n**Any idea why we are getting \"invalid image\" error from VS solution file under certain conditions? Seems to be working under .NET Core and .NET Framework, but not Mono.**\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/pythonnet/pythonnet/jobs/415741698#L1874\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrently running NuGet.exe 4.1.0.\r\nUpdating NuGet.exe to 4.7.1.\r\nUpdate successful.\r\nMSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '15.0' from '/usr/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin'.\r\nError parsing solution file at /home/travis/build/pythonnet/pythonnet/pythonnet.sln: Invalid Image\r\n```\r\n\r\nKatelyn Gadd @kg 22:36\r\ninvalid image parsing sln makes it sound like it's having trouble loading msbuild assemblies\r\nMicrosoft/msbuild#3282 this is the same error message\r\nrather, the first part is the same. different exception\r\nso it is indeed caused by a managed exception\r\nhttps://github.com/rainersigwald/msbuild/commit/7960c8032a98990d5a4a96ae0e6be7f66327e24b#diff-af08e5d2c5235a664572f4581ba0e7c6R161 it looks like msbuild has had mono compatibility issues before\r\n\r\nDenis Akhiyarov @denfromufa 22:41\r\n@kg thanks for diagnostics, any easy workaround the get the CI builds going? I don't recall these errors last week for the same build configuration:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/pythonnet/pythonnet/builds/413267958\r\n\r\nKatelyn Gadd @kg 22:42\r\ni'm sorry, i don't know enough to recommend a solution right now. you might want to ping @rainersigwald to see if he has any ideas\r\nor you could file an issue since it's an exception in msbuild to see if they can suggest a fix. i think that error message is insufficient\r\nso it is a useful defect report in the sense of 'we should at least improve this error message'\r\nit looks like it only outputs exc.Message which is insufficient in this case",
