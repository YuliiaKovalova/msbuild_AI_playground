  "body": "I'm trying to build a static graph of the projects in a very large repo. Unfortunately for reasons I don't yet understand, some of the projects in the graph fail to evaluate, and apparently any such failure is fatal, even if it's a simple matter of a missing import, which ProjectLoadSettings.IgnoreMissingImports would resolve but that's apparently not an option with static graph. \r\n\r\nI don't mind skipping nodes that don't evaluate, but I see no option to do that. I'd like to please be able to ignore missing/invalid imports as well as skipping entire nodes. Bonus points if the graph retains invalid nodes even if they're empty so we can understand how many nodes are 'missing' from the graph (understanding that more may be hiding behind the missing ones).",
