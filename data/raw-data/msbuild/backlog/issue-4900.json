  "body": "We're debugging a problem that looks like a hang in node communication. One thing that might be nice in this situation would be to preserve a circular buffer of packets sent, so that when debugging a dump of a hang you could observe what had recently been sent. This should only be kept under `MSBUILDDEBUGCOMM`, since in normal operation it's just memory bloat.\r\n\r\n(Proposed offline by @danmosemsft)",
