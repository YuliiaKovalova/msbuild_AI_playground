  "title": "Support restricting /warnaserror to msbuild specific warnings only",
  "body": "At the moment the ``/warnaserror`` command line switch for ``msbuild`` seems to make all warnings to errors, even compiler warnings. If for example in a .vcxproj file the ``TreatWarningAsError`` property is set to ``false``, this will be ignored by ``msbuild /warnaserror`` leading to failing builds despite having explicitly disabled this behaviour for certain projects or files.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see this is intended behaviour and it is possible to disable it for specific warnings with ``/nowarn``, however this will also override all local configuration, ignoring warnings where they shouldn't be ignored.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to restrict ``/warnaserror`` to only ``msbuild`` specific warnings or alternatively to honor local configuration instead of ignoring it.",
