  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nAs of SDK 3.1.401 the CopyToOutputDirectory task seems to be case sensitive when running in Linux. This makes sense, but I couldn't find any mention of it in the release notes, and it's a breaking change. Given this is a _build_ version release increment, I'm assuming the breaking change isn't intentional - so thought I'd report it. Feel free to close if this isn't the case.\r\n\r\nI've attached an example project in a zip, which shows this issue which can be run with Docker. Note at the top of the `Dockerfile` I have two lines specifying different versions of the SDK...\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1.401 AS build\r\n#FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1.302 AS build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe docker file just does an `ls` after the build...\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nRUN ls -l /src/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing a `docker build .` using 3.1.401 fails to copy testsettings.json (as you can see in the `ls` output). Doing it with 3.1.302 works.\r\n\r\nThis broke one of our builds because we were using `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1` as the base image, so as soon as 3.1.401 got released, our builds started breaking. Obviously an easy fix once we knew what it was - but it's wasn't immediately obvious why this had suddenly broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[dotnetbug.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/5260475/dotnetbug.zip)\r\n",
