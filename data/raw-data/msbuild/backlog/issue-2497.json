  "body": "I tried the following\r\nMy project.csproj:\r\n```xml\r\n\r\n<Project  ToolsVersion=\"15.0\">\r\n  <Import Project=\"Test.targets\" />\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nThe Test.targets file:\r\n```xml\r\n\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nSample:\r\n[NetStandardLib.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1272817/NetStandardLib.zip)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nI can see all cs files in Visual Studio as if it would be when i define the sdk directly within the project file\r\nI can see the SDK Node under the project tree node in VS\r\nThe build is successful\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\nNo cs files are displayed, but they are built\r\nI can see all implicit referenced standard libaries with their full path under the node Project\\references\r\nThe build fails after reopening the project with many errors \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy i want to do that?\r\nI have already a target framework that allows me to extract all common things (e.g. Configurations) between different types of projects (e.g. .net, android, pcl). Actually its a solution that is quite similar to the new standard library project format. \r\n\r\nTo update the version of netstandard libary for many projects, i want to be able to do that without touching the projects\r\n\r\nI really like the new slim format of standard libararies, but it seems that it breaks with many MSBuild features. In big project environments that could lead to frustration because you can't rely on MSBuild features that u could use without any problems in the past.\r\n",
