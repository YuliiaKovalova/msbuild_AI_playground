  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nGetAssemblyIdentity Is unable to get version info form exe files. I want to get the version of my uotput exe that is build witht he dingle file publishing under net core 3.1. But I get the following error when trying to do so: \r\n```error MSB3441: Cannot get assembly name for \"<FilePath>\". Could not load file or assembly '<File>' or one of its dependencies. The module was expected to contain an assembly manifest.```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nTry to use the ``<GetAssemblyIdentity />`` build task with any exe (I tried it with my net core publised exe and git.exe) \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI would expect msbuild to be able to extract the file version form files metadata.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nI don't know if this exact build task is the best place to implement general file version extraction. Maybe a ``<GetFileMetadata>`` or  a simpler ``<GetFileVersion>`` task would be more suitable.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nWin 10 version 1909\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.7.0-preview-20330-08+96403c598 for .NET\r\nVS 2019 Version 16.6.5",
