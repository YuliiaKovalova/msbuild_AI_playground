  "title": "Do not copy satellite assemblies to output directory",
  "body": "Currently whenever an assembly (e.g. System.Windows.Interactivity) contains references to satellite assemblies, these assemblies are automatically copied to the output directory. In a lot of cases where the final \"product\" has not localization this automatic copying can be really annying since you can only get rid of these assemblies by adding a task that deletes them afterwards as a postbuild step.\r\n\r\nIn environments where the continouus integration build takes very long this can be annyoing since first the files are copied (which costs time) and have to be deleted (which costs time). \r\n\r\nAlso every time a developer creates a small tool he has to manually add a task to delete those files.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would be helpful if there would be an option to not copy the satellite assemblies to the output directory.",
