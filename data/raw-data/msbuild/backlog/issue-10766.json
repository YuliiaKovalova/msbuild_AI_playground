  "body": "              As an extra points - we know the point in time when custom checks are done subscribing for a particualr project. At that point in time we should as well know if any check is subscribed to ProjectsImported - so we might be able to replay or discard deffered events for particular project at that point of time. And from that time on just directly feed the data to the checks (in case any subscribed).\r\n\r\nBut feel free to not solve as part of this PR if it'd turn more complicated than couple lines of code. (entering a lower priority item for that for future would be still nice though)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @JanKrivanek in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10761#discussion_r1790556535_\r\n            ",
