  "body": "_contributes to internal bug [devdiv#980195](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/980195)_\r\n\r\nRAR copies metadata from primary source items to outputs, including the `TargetPath` metadatum, and including to \"related\" non-primary output files. This means that a C# project that references a C++ WinMD project can get an item that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\source\\repos\\WapProjTemplate36\\Debug\\WindowsRuntimeComponent1\\WindowsRuntimeComponent1.pdb\r\n    TargetPath = WindowsRuntimeComponent1.winmd\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that `TargetPath` may overlap with another real file.\r\n\r\nThere's already\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/ed928d8d06ef21eb5795f6a7cc767d37d31e57bc/src/Tasks/AssemblyDependency/ReferenceTable.cs#L2918-L2926\r\n\r\nPossibly just add `TargetPath` to that would solve the problem. But we need to think through the consequences of that.",
