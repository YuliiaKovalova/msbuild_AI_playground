  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nIf a WinForm project sets `<GenerateManifests>true<GenerateManifests>` it ends up failing with \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror : MSB4803: The task \"FormatUrl\" is not supported on the .NET Core version of MSBuild. Please use the .NET Framework version of MSBuild. See https://aka.ms/msbuild/MSB4803 for further details\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not certain if this is expected to succeed since ClickOnce is now supported, but building works fine with .NET Framework msbuild.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nSee project here: https://github.com/twsouthwick/babysmash/pull/new/converted",

We don't rank issues in any particular order, is there a use case you'd have for seeing issues ranked in some way? I assume the preference would be toward higher impact issues?",

I checked and GitHub doesn't have that feature. Backlogs can be represented by grouping issues by milestone but the issues are not ranked within the milestone.\r\n\r\nThat said, given two issues that I'm equally comfortable and equipped to tackle, some indicator of which issue is more important to address might be helpful. I assume an `up-for-grabs` issue in a `VS ##.#` milestone is more important than an `up-for-grabs` issue that either has no milestone or is in the `Backlog` milestone.\r\n\r\nThanks",
