  "body": "**Incremental Build Support**\r\nMSBuild only considers the set of items computed in the current build when deciding when to execute a target. When files are included via wildcard (globbing) this can create a problem when deleting an input. The output will be up-to-date with all of the existing inputs, but should be re-built because the set of inputs has changed.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe plan to create more reliable incremental builds by recording the list of C# compiler inputs in a file to be checked between builds.",
