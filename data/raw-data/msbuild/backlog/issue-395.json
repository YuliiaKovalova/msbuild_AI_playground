  "body": "Not sure where to file this. I filed it on Microsoft Connect already, and I've spent a few days diagnosing/pulling my hair out on it. We have a .csproj that builds just fine pre-VS2015 Update 1. After Update 1 is installed, the build fails. We have \"copy\" commands in the project file that are copying files to an output directory, and they use the `%(RelativeDir)` transform. It appears instead of returning a relative path, it's returning a full path now (causing the build to fail).\n\nAny help would be appreciated, or point me in the right direction!\n",

        "body": "We got a similar report internally but I'm still waiting on follow-up from the person who reported it.  Can you post a repro project somewhere?  Even sharing just the .csproj file as a gist should be instructive.\n\nThe internal report project uses `Microsoft.WebApplication.targets` and has problems copying a `Content` item.  Is that the same for you?\n\n(A trivial project that uses `RelativeDir` seems to be fine and our tests continue to pass, so I suspect that something outside of the implementation of `RelativeDir` itself is the problem.  Unfortunately, that doesn't narrow it down much so we still need help reproducing the issue to figure out what's wrong.)\n",

        "body": "@rainersigwald thanks for replying! I will work on a repo project, but to answer your question, yes it does reference that target:\n\n``` xml\n<Import Project=\"$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v14.0\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets\" />\n```\n\nAnd here's the portion of our `.csproj` that is failing:\n\n``` xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <ProjectDir Condition=\" '$(ProjectDir)' == '' \">$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\</ProjectDir>\n    <IntermediateDir>$(SolutionDir)deploy\\_Packages\\$(ProjectName)\\</IntermediateDir>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <BuildDependsOn>\n          BeforeBuild;\n          CompileTypeScript;\n    </BuildDependsOn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n<Target Name=\"Build\" DependsOnTargets=\"$(BuildDependsOn)\">\n    <ItemGroup>\n      <NewIntermediateFiles Include=\"@(Content)\" />\n      <NewIntermediateFiles Include=\"@(ScssFile)\" />\n      <OldIntermediateFiles Include=\"$(IntermediateDir)**\\*.*\" />\n      <DeleteIntermediateFiles Include=\"@(OldIntermediateFiles)\" />\n      <DeleteIntermediateFiles Remove=\"@(NewIntermediateFiles->'$(IntermediateDir)%(RelativeDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')\" />\n    </ItemGroup>\n    <Delete Files=\"@(DeleteIntermediateFiles)\" />\n    <Copy SourceFiles=\"@(NewIntermediateFiles)\" DestinationFiles=\"@(NewIntermediateFiles->'$(IntermediateDir)%(RelativeDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')\" SkipUnchangedFiles=\"true\" />\n  </Target>\n```\n\nSpecifically, that last `<Copy>` statement is spitting out a full path for `%(RelativeDir)` instead of a relative one, causing the copy to fail with an error message.\n",
