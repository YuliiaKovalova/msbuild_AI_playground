  "body": "Hi @rainersigwald,\r\n\r\nIn this .Net6.0-Windows VS2022 VSIX Extension Project which I have given the Link below, when I build the project, the '.vsix' file is not getting created. Only the project's '.dll' file is getting created.\r\n\r\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!AjNAB3KpbqsEkW5cDsD_kQ4hBKsN?e=OnRqMd\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE :: I have used Uprade-Assistant on my old VSIX project and got this project. Is that the correct way?\r\n\r\nAlso in addition to the issue above, when we compile it, then in the Visual Studio Output Window (the last few lines), we get warnings like this one::\r\n\r\n1>D:\\Goodbyte VSIX\\GoodbyteHelperExtension\\GoodbyteHelperExtension.csproj : warning NU1701: Package 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Editor 17.0.491' **was restored using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1,** .NETFramework,Version=v4.6.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8.1' **instead of the project target framework 'net6.0-windows7.0'. This package may not be fully compatible with your project**.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nGarevaul\r\n",

        "body": "Commenting here because this is the first result that shows up when you search `vsix project does not output vsix file`.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n- My VSIX project no longer outputs a `.vsix` file.\r\n- If I create a new VSIX project from the \"VSIX project\" template in VS2022, that project _does_ output a `.vsix` file, so the issue is with my project.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nMy VSIX project had been converted to an SDK-style project:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" ToolsVersion=\"15.0\">\r\n...\r\n```\r\nVisual Studio does not support many VSIX development features for SDK-style projects (e.g. you cannot open the `.vsixmanifest` project in the designer editor). \r\n\r\nYou can fix the issue by converting back to the old project style, which is still used by the \"VSIX Project\" template. Create a new project using this template and diff the `.csproj` files if you need an example.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/Microsoft/VSProjectSystem/issues/257",
