  "body": "Currently more than half of all logging is by BuildMessageEventArgs with large message text.\r\n\r\nThey're categorized into four main categories:\r\n\r\n1. Task Parameter:\r\n2. Output Item(s):\r\n3. Added Item(s):\r\n4. Removed Item(s):\r\n\r\nMessages typically reach up to 5MB in size for a single string.\r\n\r\nHere's a sampling:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/KirillOsenkov/952b0798a760450cc2ae3b5aed3778c3\r\n\r\nMore stats and details here:\r\nhttps://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/wiki/BinLog-Stats\r\n\r\nIt would be better if we introduced a custom message type derived from BuildMessageEventArgs, and stored the items on the message in a structured way, without collapsing them into a single giant string. This way loggers would still get the same behavior, but loggers that are aware (such as BinaryLogger) would efficiently serialize the items without concatenating them into a single string unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nI expect this to have huge benefits for logging throughput, memory pressure as well as binlog size and binlog loading speed.\r\n",
