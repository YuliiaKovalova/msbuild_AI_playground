  "body": "\r\n### Issue Description\r\n\r\nmsbuild's code is open source under the MIT license. This allows anyone to examine, modify and distribute the sources (among other things). However, the source code repository includes a documentation file that has a \"Microsoft Confidential\" notice: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/src/Shared/Shared%20Code.doc\r\n\r\nI suspect this is a mistake since there is a lot of documentation in `.md` files in this repository; those files do not carry such a notice.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what that means, legally speaking: is this file under a non-free license?\r\n\r\nAs an aside, perhaps that document should be converted to markdown like all other documentation files in this repo? There are no other `.doc` files in this repo.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTry and read https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/src/Shared/Shared%20Code.doc\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThis is all open source and publicly usable\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere's a \"Microsoft Confidential\" notice.",
