  "body": "Consider this:\n\n``` cmd\nmsbuild /m /nr:true someBigProject.proj\nmsbuild /m /nr:false someOtherProject.proj\n```\n\nMost people would expect the first build to leave child processes running (that being the point of the `/nodeReuse` flag).  The second shouldn't leave any new processes running.\n\nWhat's surprising is that the second build will reuse processes left over from the first build.  That causes problems if you have per-node state, or if you're looking at I/O from the process cone of MSBuild.\n\nThis appears to be intentional but I can't justify the behavior.  I think we should change `/nr:false` to always spawn new processes.\n",
