  "body": "I'm facing a problem that when the projects were built successfully, no folder known as 15.0 was generated.\r\nI might have missed some essential files or incorrect configuration steps that leads to this inconsistency in building.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Install Visual Studio 2017. Select the following Workloads:\r\n    .NET desktop development\r\n    .NET Core cross-platform development\r\n2. Install the .NET Core 2.1 SDK.\r\n3. Clone the source code (see above).\r\n4. Open a Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 prompt.\r\n5. Build the code using the build.cmd script. This also restores packages needed to open the projects in Visual Studio.\r\n6. Open MSBuild.sln in Visual Studio 2017.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nWhen build success, a folder known as 15.0 was generated containing the products.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nWhen build success, no folder known as 15.0 was generated.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n``` msbuild /version ``` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 14.0.25420.1\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
