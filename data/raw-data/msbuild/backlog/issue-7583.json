  "title": "Custom serialization after BinaryFormatter Removal",
  "body": "Per the [BinaryFormatter deprecation schedule](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2020/better-obsoletion/binaryformatter-obsoletion.md#net-7-nov-2022), the use of BinaryFormatter in all first-party Microsoft code is deprecated in .NET 7, so we are planning for its eventual removal. MSBuild currently uses it for serializing custom `BuildEventArgs` and `ITaskItem`s. If you use that functionality, we want to know! Head over to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/discussions/7582 and let us know how you use it and why.",
