  "title": "[Bug]: Unable to remove projects with dynamic platform resolution",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe current behavior for dynamic platform resolution is that if a project is unable to determing what a dependent should be built as, it simply builds that dependency with a blank global platform value, allowing that dependency to build as its default platform. In cases like traversal projects, this is not the behavior wanted. instead there should be an option to remove the dependency from the graph if platform is unable to be negotiated.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a project with dynamic platform resolution enabled that builds as x64 and a dependent project that only builds as x86. Make sure there is not mapping defined\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nYou should be able to choose if this dependent project is kept in the graph\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nthe project is kept in the graph every time without option.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
