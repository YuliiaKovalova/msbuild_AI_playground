Recently, one of my coworkers has started having problems with the project, where it will restore correctly but won't import MSBuild Community tasks (it does import the internal package).  The fun part is that the exact same project will build on any of our other machines and our build server; it only fails on coworker's machine.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could be causing this?\r\n\r\nHere's a slightly stripped down copy of the common build script, and the generated .props and .targets files from both my machine and the coworker's.\r\n[MSBuildFiles.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/5591156/MSBuildFiles.zip)\r\n",
