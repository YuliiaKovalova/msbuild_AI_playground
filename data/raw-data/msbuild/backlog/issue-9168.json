But that should not be required.\r\n\r\nClosing this issue since it is a duplicate of https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/23935",

And to see a response like the the above (\"You could try to rebuild the solution...\") from @AR-May is so disappointing.  I added the above comment therefore in the hope to make of you aware of the futility of such irresponsible comment, and of the urgency of the situation so that users facing this issue will receive a proper fix (at the earliest) that we can incorporate into our Automated MSBuild scripts so that we are tired of explaining to our Dev Mgrs and CTO each time as to why we are having to take manual steps during our build & deployment process (despite having a comprehensive automated build scripts for all our solutions) because Microsoft has still not provided a solution to fix this issue even after more than 18 months of us reporting the issue.",
