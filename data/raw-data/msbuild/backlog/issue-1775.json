Soon that became leaky for perf - constructing and sending the messages only to have the logger drop them. Another example is 'onlylogcriticalevents' that causes almost nothing to go to the logger in quiet mode.",

If it's only enabled when a logger is in diagnostic it seems reasonable if it didn't accept performance. @KirillOsenkov Can you measure this and consider as part of the binary logger change please?",
