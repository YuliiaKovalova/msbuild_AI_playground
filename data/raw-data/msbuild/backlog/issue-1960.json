We call in to NuGet to get the \"nearest\" target framework, and net4.0 is consider \"nearer\" to net4.6 than netstandard1.3.\r\n\r\nThere is an escape hatch to override the automatic selection, which is to provide the SetTargetFramework metadata yourself.\r\n\r\nThe following should work:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Foo.Library\\Foo.Library.csproj\" SetTargetFramework=\"TargetFramework=net4.0\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

For example, I have helper methods in the library that are using `Console.WriteLine`. Unfortunately, I get the following error when I use them:\r\n\r\n> System.IO.FileNotFoundException occurred\r\n>   HResult=0x80070002\r\n>   Message=Could not load file or assembly 'System.Console, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.
