  "title": "Add a TaskHost implementation to support cross-runtime tasks",
  "body": "Adding the two TaskHost implementations linked below lets MSBuild, either for the .NET Framework or .NET, work bidirectionally. This gives our customers freedom to migrate on their own terms, instead of en-masse. It also smooths the path towards a unified version of MSBuild for .NET - where all tasks can be run from one host and we can simplify this repository somewhat.",
