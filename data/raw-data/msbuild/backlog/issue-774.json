  "body": "After https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3102 is fixed.  The next issue that the CLI will be blocked on is that the generated $(ProjectName).nuget.props and $(ProjectName).nuget.targets files are not loaded when using MSBuild on .NET Core.\n\nFrom my preliminary debugging, it appears that the Common.props/targets files are not loading up the Microsoft.NuGet.props/.targets when on .NET Core.\n\nNormally on desktop builds, these NuGet .props and .targets files are loaded because they are installed to the \"ImportBefore\"/\"ImportAfter\" folders in Program Files.  However, these folder locations are not applicable on .NET Core.\n\nThis is blocking the CLI using MSBuild to build .csprojs for .NET Core cross-plat.\n",
