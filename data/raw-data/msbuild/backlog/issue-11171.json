  "body": "### Motivation\n\nChangeWave optout should be tailored to optout of a specific behavior - let's not \"auto-bump\" the optout to newer waves automatically. This can lead to unexpected changes in behavior\n\n### Sample case\n\n##[warning]Environment variable MSBUILDDISABLEFEATURESFROMVERSION is set to a version that is out of rotation. Defaulting to Change Wave version: 17.10. Entered value: 17.6. Current Change Waves: [17.10, 17.12]. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSpecifying old changewave doesn't have any effect\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSpecifying old changewave opts out of newer behavior",
