  "body": "When investigating on why my incremental build was not that incremental I had a hard time understanding why a specific resource file was always recompiled. It took me hours to download / compile and understand correctly what was goind wrong.\r\n\r\nIn my case I was hitting:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/a9f64ebd108702c3fc65339c66cb124217854524/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L1428-L1433\r\n\r\nBut my file is not missing, the path is only badly formatted: `...\\Resources\\BuildTagIcon.png` (notice the threed dots). For `NativeMethodsShared.GetFileAttributesEx` it's not valid but it's ok for the resource generator. \r\n\r\nWe sure can fix this issue but I guess it would be more useful to add some logs. Once I knew which resource was the culprit it was quite easy to understand why.",
