  "body": "The status messages could use some improvement in MSBuild. Instead of hard-coding \"Build succeeded\", MSBuild should report \"$(Target) succeeded \" or \"$(Target) failed\" for example.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a bit of a functional difference between Mono's `xbuild` and `msbuild`. In 15.2 we switched to `msbuild` by default, deprecating `xbuild`. As such, we had a Xamarin platform bug filed for this issue.\r\n\r\n* [Original Xamarin bug](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=56753)\r\n* [Screencast of issue](https://www.screencast.com/t/gpcdoMnZ)",

        "body": "@radical is this really something where `xbuild` logged differently? That's surprising.\r\n\r\nTeam triage: This is not something we expect to change. An invocation of MSBuild is a \"build\", even if you specify targets that do something that you don't think of as a build. See related https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1179.\r\n\r\nThere is possibly some room to change the log message for clarity, but I can't come up with a particularly good phrasing. In Slack there was a suggestion of `Build ({specified_target}) completed`. I don't like changing the string out of fear of breaking people grepping for `Build succeeded` . . .",
