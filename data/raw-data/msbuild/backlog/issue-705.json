  "title": "x64 Tracker tries to read from amd32 folder",
  "body": "This is a regression introduced by #650.\n\nWhen the 64-bit MSBuild.exe is invoked directly (and the msbuild binary directory is not on the `PATH`), `tracker.exe` will search the wrong directory for `FileTracker32.dll` when it encounters a 32-bit (x86) application. When it fails to find it, it throws this dialog:\n\n```\n---------------------------\ncl.exe - System Error\n---------------------------\nThe program can't start because C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\bin\\amd32\\FileTracker32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem. \n---------------------------\nOK   \n---------------------------\n```\n\nNote that it's looking in `amd`**`32`** instead of just `bin`, the correct location.\n\nThis most commonly occurs when using 64-bit MSBuild to build a `.vcxproj` that produces a 32-bit application, because the C++ default is to use 32-bit tools to produce a 32-bit app.\n\nThis is likely due to bad fallback code in Tracker's C++ source (which is Microsoft-internal, not open source).\n\nThere is a known workaround:\n- Use 64-bit tools to cross-compile, ensuring that x86 applications don't run during the build. For the standard C++ tools, this can be controlled by setting the property `PreferredToolArchitecture=x64`.\n\n(Thanks for the report + workaround, @yuehuang010!)\n",
