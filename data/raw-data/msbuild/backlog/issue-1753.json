  "body": "I used to launch an elevated notepad to change the msbuild.rsp file in the PF32\\msbuild directory after installing VS to set a bunch of switches. But now msbuild is part of VS2017 and I update it frequently, and each time msbuild updates, the .rsp file is reset. This makes it much more frustrating to keep the file current.\r\n\r\nI shouldn't have to elevate anyway. MSBuild.exe already searches two locations (the project directory and the installation directory) for .rsp files. Can we add the %USERPROFILE% directory as another?",
