  "title": "Create spec for new single-proc node mode",
  "body": "The spec would need to capture:\n* the API contract for the new kind of Task\n  * the new Task should support modern .NET expectations, including but not limited to\n    * async support (Task/ValueTask/etc)\n    * Cancellation (ctok parameter, managed/injected by the engine as part of the `ExecuteAsync` call)\n  * the new Task should support a 'context' object parameter to `ExecuteAsync` that the engine can use to host APIs that are otherwise dangerous in a multi-threaded environment\n* the behavior of the engine with respect to the new Task:\n  * support for using the new Task in existing out-of-proc worker nodes\n  * support for using the new Task in a new, in-proc single-threaded worker node\n  * support for forcing the engine to use one of these modes or the other (as a fallback/compatibility mechanism)",
