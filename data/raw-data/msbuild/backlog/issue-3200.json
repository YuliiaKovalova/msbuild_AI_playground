  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Create a new solution with two projects (A and B)\r\n* Make project A dependent on B (to enforce build order)\r\n* Add a new text file to project B and set it to \"Copy Always\"\r\n* Build from within visual studio and inspect the output \r\n* text file IS NOT present in the build output. \r\n* Build using MSBuild from the command line (C# Cake or TeamCity)\r\n* text file IS present in the build output. \r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nCalling MSBuild externally from Visual Studio should have the same behavior. The text file should not be copied to the output of the dependent project (it's not a reference). \r\n\r\n### Example\r\nAttached is an example solution with C# Cake build script. \r\n[MSBuildError.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1916333/MSBuildError.zip)\r\n",
