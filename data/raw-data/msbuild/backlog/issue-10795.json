  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nStackoverflow reference here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77929595/how-do-i-late-resolve-in-csproj-files\n\nThe stackoverflow reproduction is overshortened; what's going on is the \"dotnet run\" command runs a direct dependency.\n\nTrying to fix it:\n```\nBeforeTargets=\"BeforeBuild\" is too early\nBeforeTargets=\"PrepareResources\" is too late\nBeforeTargets=\"BeforeCompile\" is too late\nBeforeTargets=\"BeforePrepareResources\" cannot function as that target doesn't exist\n```\n\nRegression? Probably. According to our git repo; this worked in the feature development branch on 2024-02-05 on .NET 8 (which means the sdk must be a .NET 8 version but I can't ask git history for the exact sdk version) and broke since. I can't get a sane answer of the branch maintainer when it started failing because he conflates it with this bug: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9179\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1) Unpack this[msbuildrace.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17335409/msbuildrace.zip) zip file; it creates a directory msbuildrace\n\n2) from a clean tree; try to build the dll and get the error\n`...\\msbuildrace\\dll> dotnet build`\n\n3) try to fix that error by changing BeforeBuild to BeforeCompile and try again\n`...\\msbuildrace\\dll>sed -i s/BeforeTargets=^\"BeforeBuild^\"/BeforeTargets=^\"BeforeCompile^\" dll.csproj`\n`...\\msbuildrace\\dll>dotnet build`\n`...\\msbuildrace\\dll>dir bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\*.dat`\n\nThere should be two .dat files in the compilation output but we got none.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBuild runs through and expands * after the custom build step runs so that CopyToOutputDirectory works\n\nNote that having the tool write them to the output directory *doesn't work* because this is a dll and the copy needs to propagate.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nRandom build breakage depending on a CPU race condition; I think I made a reliable reproduction but it might not be.\n\n### Analysis\n\nmsbuild does wildcard expansion too soon\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nD:\\dev>dotnet --version\n8.0.403\n\nD:\\dev>dotnet msbuild --version\nMSBuild version 17.11.9+a69bbaaf5 for .NET\n17.11.9.46202\n\nWe don't use the standalone msbuild; only dotnet build (which contains an embedded copy of msbuild)",
