It would be nice if [build time match based item operations](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/d38f1c59428795e3a125d99742141646613a6eff/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/IntrinsicTasks/ItemGroupIntrinsicTask.cs#L454) also reuse this code to avoid behaviour drift. Right now eval time matching has some extra capabilities that makes it behave differently from build time matching (e.g. the ability to compare absolute paths with relative paths).\r\n\r\nClones that parse / expand itemspecs or match items:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/31ccfa3cc54d20da3edf0d862280d2a0e572f80a/src/XMakeBuildEngine/Definition/Project.cs#L2181-L2200\r\n- [ ]  https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/XMakeBuildEngine/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/IntrinsicTasks/ItemGroupIntrinsicTask.cs#L448-L511\r\n\r\n  ",

The problem we're hitting is with xunit.abstractions (https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1983), which was resolved as a dupe of https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1054 (which is not assigned to any milestone). Could you triage that one? Thanks!",
