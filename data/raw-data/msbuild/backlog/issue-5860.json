  "body": "<!-- This is a template that helps us provide quicker feedback. Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\nWe are talking about .Net Framework projects using **ProjectReference**.\r\n\r\nSome project entries in project.assets.json are named after the project name and some are named after the respective assembly name. The logic behind selecting one or another is unclear and makes it hard to write custom processing of this file. For example, to deal with the binding redirect hell.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nhttps://github.com/MarkKharitonov/PackageAssetsJsonAnomaly#the-anomaly - this repository contains 3 tiny projects and describes the repro steps in README.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe names of project entries follow a consistent scheme - either project or assembly names, but not mixed.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nOn a sample solution with 3 tiny projects, the project.assets.json file names one project dependency after the project name and another - after the assembly name.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nI do not have an idea, but I am afraid it is related to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64576860/why-does-console-build-generate-radically-different-project-assets-json-than-tha\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nhttps://github.com/MarkKharitonov/PackageAssetsJsonAnomaly#the-anomaly\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\nhttps://github.com/MarkKharitonov/PackageAssetsJsonAnomaly/blob/master/msbuild.binlog\r\n",
