        "body": "So, while I agree it is confusing and that we should review what goes into what dll there are some cases that this switch is intentional. \r\n\r\nFor example, in a recent PR I had to transfer a enum [BuildRequestDataFlags](https://github.com/maridematte/msbuild/blob/main/src/Framework/BuildRequestDataFlags.cs) to the `src/Framework` folder, but the namespace needed to be kept as `Microsoft.Build.Execution`.\r\n\r\nEach folder represents a `.dll` file that we pack and ship, almost everything under those folders are packed with their respective .dll and have different dependencies between them. In the case that I'm talking about, we needed the `BuildRequestDataFlags` to be accessible in the `Framework` package, but it was localted was in the `execution` package. `Framework` does not depend on `Execution` so there were cases where the type was completely inaccessible. \r\nBy having `BuildRequestDataFlags` be packed within `Framework`  we guaranteed that it would be accessible by any code from `Framework` but we had to keep the namespace and type forward so we could keep backwards compatibility and have no changes in our API.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**: Sometimes it is intentional that classes are in different namespaces than the folder they are under, but we should review this stuff for sure.",
