        "body": "For an actual useful report of the issue and not just my snarky hot take on social media, our CI on https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet has been flaky on Windows (only, it seems) lately due to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB3923: Failed to download file \"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/download/dev/wasmtime-dev-aarch64-linux-c-api.tar.xz\". Authentication failed, see inner exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur CI uses the `DownloadFile` task to pull down different tarballs of Wasmtime's libraries on the supported platforms to create our NuGet package.\r\n\r\nAs it is a public GitHub URL that should not require authentication, it's likely that it's either a GitHub infrastructure issue (judging from the exception, a TLS issue?) or the download is being throttled and just so happens to fail this way.\r\n\r\nHowever, without knowing what the inner exception contained, it is quite difficult to diagnose the underlying problem using the `DownloadFile` task as currently implemented.",
