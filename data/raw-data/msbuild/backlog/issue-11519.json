  "body": "### Summary\n\nUsing MSBuild APIs to do the equivalent of `msbuild.exe -restore` is complicated: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/fcd9a9224c91132226206ebd15922e42fb3ed483/src/Cli/dotnet/commands/VirtualProjectBuildingCommand.cs#L51-L80\n\nIt would be nice to have an API for this instead.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/2414 introduced implicit restore command line argument but no API as far as I can see.\n\nSimilar issue for MSBuild Task: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/2811\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nSomething like `new BuildRequestData(..., implicitRestore: true)`?\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
