  "title": "Task XslTransformation: How to specify XmlSpace.Preserve?",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nThe MSBuild Task XslTransformation ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/xsltransformation-task?view=vs-2022), [source](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Tasks/XslTransformation.cs)) always loads the provided XSLT file with `XmlSpace.Default`. I would like to use `XmlSpace.Preserve` instead.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nSee [this project](https://github.com/NMertsch/msbuild-xsltransformation-issue). It contains an XSL stylesheet, an input XML file, and a dotnet project that generates two output files: one with the XslTransformation task, one in `Program.cs`. It also contains both output files so you can see the difference in GitHub.\r\n\r\nYou can clone the repo, delete the generated files, and run `dotnet run` to re-generate them.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nBoth files have the same content.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe MSBuild Task does not preserve whitespace and offers no way to change this behavior (at least none that I was able to find).\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe desired behavior can be achieved by changing `new XPathDocument(reader)` to `new XPathDocument(reader, XmlSpace.Preserve)` in [this line](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/bfd80ab1692721767c3fa8c0d4bcd35254489086/src/Tasks/XslTransformation.cs#L446).\r\n\r\nI'm happy that `XmlSpace.Default` is the default. But I'd like to have an option to use `XmlSpace.Preserve` instead, e.g. via `<XslTransformation PreserveWhitespace=\"true\" ... />`.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nTo reproduce this, I use the dotnet CLI without IDE.\r\n- `dotnet --version`: 6.0.300\r\n- OS: Windows 10 Pro (Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044)\r\n",
