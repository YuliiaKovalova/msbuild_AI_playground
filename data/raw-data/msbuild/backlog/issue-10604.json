  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThere are special MSBuild recognized properties (e.g. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-properties) that are being interpreted by the runtime without calling expander. For such we miss the usage in the `BC0203` check and flag the definitions.\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\n\r\nAdd `<MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors>true</MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors>` to your project file and build with `/check`\r\n\r\n**Observed:**\r\n```\r\n    MSBUILD : error BC0203: C:\\repro\\TestProj.csproj (12,7): https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#BC0203 - Property: [MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors] was declared/initialized, but it was never used.\r\n```\r\n**Expected:**\r\n\r\nNo error is logged\r\n\r\n### More info\r\n\r\nThe `MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors` is dereferenced here: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/4dc5611154bf8988de16b5173f64cb5758d53c17/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L1372\r\n\r\nWe should try to see how couple other well known props are dereferenced and route the info from those reads to the check.\r\nOther option is to add a listof well known properties to the check itself - but that is prone to regressions.\r\n\r\n### Loosely related\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10597",
