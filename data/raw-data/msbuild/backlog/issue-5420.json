  "body": "The .NET CLI supports `--output` as a parameter to the build command, and [translates this](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/d30e9ba1fe915d99cd3455bda9b41cde42775fbe/src/Cli/dotnet/commands/dotnet-build/BuildCommandParser.cs#L23-L27) into a `-property:OutputPath` parameter to MSBuild.\r\n\r\nSince this is a global property, it will flow to referenced projects and they will all build with the same output path.  This isn't safe.  We should add `OutputPath` to a list of properties which we remove when building project references.\r\n\r\n",

I think we'd at least need an opt-out; maybe we should do an opt-in and opt in at the SDK layer?",
