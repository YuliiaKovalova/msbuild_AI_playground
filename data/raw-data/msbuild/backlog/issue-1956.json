  "body": "I'm not sure whether this is, in fact, a bug in MSBuild but I don't seem to find any other place to ask for help (my [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42613757/sonarqube-scanner-for-msbuild-on-macos-using-mono) did not yield any results).\r\n\r\nWhen trying to use SonarQube MSBuild Scanner with MSBuild 15 on macOS with a Xamarin solution, the MSBuild build does not seem to produce the output expected by the scanner.\r\n\r\nI can successfully run the scanner's \"begin\" using mono like so:\r\n\r\n`mono sonar-scanner-msbuild-2/SonarQube.Scanner.MSBuild.exe begin /k:\"KEY\"`\r\n\r\nThe command creates the following files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.sonarqube/conf/SonarQubeAnalysisConfig.xml\r\n.sonarqube/conf/SonarQubeRoslyn-cs.ruleset\r\n.sonarqube/conf/cs/SonarLint.xml\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm running MSBuild using:\r\n\r\n`msbuild /t:Rebuild`\r\n\r\nNow the build starts correctly but eventually terminates with two errors:\r\n\r\nThe scanner is invoked to end the scan process like so:\r\n\r\n`mono sonar-scanner-msbuild-2/SonarQube.Scanner.MSBuild.exe end`\r\n\r\nThis outputs the following information:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSonarQube Scanner for MSBuild 2.2\r\nDefault properties file was found at sonar-scanner-msbuild-2/SonarQube.Analysis.xml\r\nLoading analysis properties from sonar-scanner-msbuild-2/SonarQube.Analysis.xml\r\nPost-processing started.\r\nSonarQube Scanner for MSBuild 2.2\r\nThe SonarQube MSBuild integration failed: SonarQube was unable to collect the required information about your projects.\r\nPossible causes:\r\n  1. The project has not been built - the project must be built in between the begin and end steps\r\n  2. An unsupported version of MSBuild has been used to build the project. Currently MSBuild 12.0 upwards are supported\r\n  3. The begin, build or end steps have not all been launched from the same folder\r\nGeneration of the sonar-properties file failed. Unable to complete SonarQube analysis.\r\n23:25:26.863  Creating a summary markdown file...\r\n23:25:26.868  Post-processing failed. Exit code: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's missing in MSBuild on macOS to make this work?\r\n\r\nMoreover, I stumbled upon information somewhere that indicated that it might be required to add an import for the scanner's targets to the .csproj files in the solution:\r\n\r\n`<Import Project=\"sonar-scanner-msbuild-2/Targets/SonarQube.Integration.ImportBefore.targets\" />`\r\n\r\nBut when I do this and run the build, MSBuild complains with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuild FAILED.\r\n\r\n\"SomeProject/SomeProject.sln\" (Rebuild target) (1) ->\r\n\"SomeProject/SomeProject.Core/SomeProject.Core.csproj\" (Rebuild target) (2) ->\r\n(CoreCompile target) -> \r\n  CSC : error CS2001: Source file /additionalfile:SomeProject/.sonarqube/conf/SomeProject.Core_AnyCPU_Debug_0473/ProjectOutFolderPath.txt' could not be found [SomeProject/SomeProject.Core/SomeProject.Core.csproj]\r\n\r\n    0 Warning(s)\r\n    1 Error(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking the file system, the file does actually exist. Why would MSBuild not be able to find / access this file? Is there anything that can be done about it?\r\n\r\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated!",
