  "title": "Bad error message when referencing a non-SDK multitargeting project ",
  "body": "Given a .NET Framework project (non-SDK) referenced by any project, (erroneously) add\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\t  <TargetFrameworks>net46;net8.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n```\r\n\r\nto try to make it multitarget. That is ignored by the non-SDK common targets, so the individual project can build, but the referencing project fails before RPR, leaving you with\r\n\r\n```sh-session\r\n> msbuild -bl\r\n  ClassLibrary2 succeeded (0.1s) \u2192 ClassLibrary2\\bin\\Debug\\ClassLibrary2.dll\r\nYou are using a preview version of .NET. See: https://aka.ms/dotnet-support-policy\r\n  ClassLibrary2 failed with 1 error(s) (0.0s)\r\n    C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Preview\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1967,5): error : Internal MSBuild error: Non-CrossTargeting GetTargetFrameworks target should not be used in cross targeting (outer) build\r\n\r\nBuild failed with 1 error(s) in 0.6s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat error isn't _wrong_ but it sure doesn't help you fix the problem.",
