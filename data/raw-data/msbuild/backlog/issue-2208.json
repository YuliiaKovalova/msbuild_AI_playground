  "title": "Incorrect assembly version resolution under Mono 5.0",
  "body": "When using MSBuild under Mono 5.0.1.1, it fails to correctly resolve assemby references for gtk-sharp (version 2.12). There are two versions installed into the GAC (2.12 and 3.0), and MSBuild does not select 2.12 for a project which references it. Instead, it arbitrarily picks 3.0.\r\n\r\nxbuild does not have this problem, and correctly resolves the assembly.\r\n\r\nThis causes projects which use GTK#2 to not be able to be built with MSBuild. An example of an affected project can be examined here: https://github.com/Nihlus/Launchpad\r\n\r\n--\r\nSystem Info\r\n--\r\nLinux Mint 18.1 Cinnamon Edition\r\nMono 5.0.1.1 (Xamarin release via repository)\r\nMSBuild 15.2.0.0\r\nxbuild 14.0\r\nlibgtk2.0-cil (2.12.43-0xamarin7+debian7b1)",
