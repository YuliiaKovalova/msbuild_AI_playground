  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n<!--\r\n* Please include a clear and concise description of the problem.\r\n-->\r\nUsing 16.11.0.36601 version of MsBuild, the graphBuild is not working.  It has something to do with this:\r\n1. When attempting to build a specific .csproj of a solution, there's not enough options to specify that we want to use the \"Release|Any CPU\" configuration because it wants to use \"AnyCPU\" instead without spaces.  Although when specifying AnyCPU works, the dependent C++ projects that rely on the \"Any CPU\" target fail, so they don't build.   The error message suggests to specify the solution.\r\n2. However, when specifying the solution, it doesn't work because our project names have dots in the names.   The documentation states that dots should be converted to underscores, but doing this doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI'm just trying to determine what the dependencies are of a given .csproj programmatically.   The solution has a combination of .NET Framework and C++, and some of the projects are SDK projects, while others are not.   Visual Studio, and MSBuild on the build server is clearly capable of of figuring out dependencies since the solution builds, but on the build server, ms build runs the entire solution.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what the rules are that will effectively determine the full dependency tree of a project, just like Visual Studio can do -- and supposedly MSBuild can do.  I'd like to do it without modifying the solution (it belongs to a client and I'd like to avoid changing the solution / project structure if at all possible)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following as possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n-->\r\nBefore I come up with steps to reproduce, which would take me a little while, I'd like first find out if the scenario I'm talking about is supposed to work.   For instance, if .NET Framework, C++ or non-SDK projects are not supported for the \"graphBuild\" parameter, then I want to avoid wasting the effort to construct a reproducible case.   So someone gets back to me and let me know if this is even a target / goal of this project.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n<!--\r\n* If providing us a project that reproduces the issue proves difficult, consider including a binlog.\r\n* Click [here](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog) for details on sharing binary logs.\r\n* Click [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md) for more information on binary logs.\r\n    NOTE: Binlogs can contain sensitive information. Don't attach anything you don't want to be public.\r\n\r\n*   To view the contents of the binlogs yourself, you may wish to use a tool like https://msbuildlog.com/.\r\n-->",
