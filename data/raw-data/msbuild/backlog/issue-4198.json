  "body": "When authoring a NuGet package that's designed to deliver custom ITask implementations to be run at build time by the dotnet-sdk / Visual Studio / etc., authors need to know which runtimes to support.\r\n\r\nDo the dependency groups in the Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core package indicate which runtimes are supported?\r\nMaybe this an issue better off in the docs repository (documentation around the topic is kind of scarce generally)... but i'm not sure.",

MSBuild 16.0 runs on `net472` and `netcoreapp2.0`.\r\n\r\nBecause of complexities around netstandard support in .NET 4.6.2 to 4.7.1, I wouldn't recommend trying to use a netstandard task assembly in full framework build; it's worth the pain of multitargeting your task and selecting the right implementation to avoid the runtime problems.\r\n\r\nDoes that answer the question? I agree that this should be better documented.",

Do MSBuild-specific docs.microsoft.com documentation issues go here or into visualstudio-docs?",
