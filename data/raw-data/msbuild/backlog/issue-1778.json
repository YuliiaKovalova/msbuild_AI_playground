That feels like a bug to me, but likely a hard one to fix since folks will depend on it...",

        "body": "I suspect that the difference is that inside a target, the metadata reference causes batching, so the actual item-creation code sees a literal string that's the expansion of `%(Identity)` for the item being batched over (`@(Test)`).\r\n\r\nThat's extremely confusing and it's not good that the behavior changes in this way. But I suspect you're right that it'll be hard or impossible to fix this. I confirmed that this behavior is the same in MSBuild  4.6.1586.0 (pre-MSBuild 12).",
