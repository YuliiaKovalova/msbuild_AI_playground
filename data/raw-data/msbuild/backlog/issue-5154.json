There's some lossiness in the sln->metaproj conversion, because the metaproj is specialized to a specific configuration/platform when it's constructed (since it's intended to be transient).\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate on your scenario? Maybe there's something else that could be done.",

A tool then  reads it, creates a _.metaproj_ file  and passes it to _msbuild_ using _Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager.Build(BuildParameters, BuildRequestData)_.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering if it was possible to use the _.metaproj_ file to create a _.sln_ file.\r\n\r\nOne approach looked at is using the [_EnvDTE_ API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/envdte) to build a solution instead of building the _.metaproj_ file.\r\n\r\nAlso, looked at using _Microsoft.CodeAnalysis_ from _Roslyn_, but don't see support for saving solutions using _Workspace_ or _AdhocWorkspace_.",
