        "body": "Good point about it being a compiler error. The differences between the compiler command line are essentially this (in addition to the different path to csc.exe):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- /nowarn:1701,1702,1705,CS1591\r\n+ /nowarn:CS1591\r\n```\r\n\r\nCS1701 is an error in the build output, so the fact that it's no longer being suppressed seems to be what's breaking it. In fact I tried executing the exact same (broken) command line in both VS dev windows and it failed. So it appears to be a breaking change made in msbuild .targets, presumably(?) those owned by Roslyn?\r\n\r\n**UPDATED**: this comment was updated with the correct diff and analysis after I realized my first diff was of the wrong command line.",
