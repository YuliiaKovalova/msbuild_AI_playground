  "body": "Full-framework MSBuild has a fair amount of code that identifies what toolset to use for a given project, and then uses that toolset to identify various behavior knobs.  In our CoreCLR version, we're currently thinking that we won't have the concept of a toolset--if you want a different \"toolset\", invoke a different msbuild.exe.\n\nRight now this behavior is feature-flagged behind a few different flags, but we should have a nice, easy-to-understand story about what is impacted with a single flag.\n",
