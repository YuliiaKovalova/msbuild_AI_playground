  "body": "This issue comes from our Windows Watson failure telemetry and presents as an unhandled null-ref exception. The exception is generated from [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/ab6fed11b32ae1a89357b2c8cbaa9471876f77ff/src/XMakeBuildEngine/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L2655) method when trying to form an error message for an import not found. I'm not sure what the scenario really is here, but the issue occurs when there is fallback defined in the Toolset for a property that is not defined. In that case we crash when trying to form the error message if we couldn't find the import.",
