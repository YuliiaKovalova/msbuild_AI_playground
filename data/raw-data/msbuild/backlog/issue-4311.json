  "body": "###Goal\r\nSDK that don't have targets or props, but a tool can generates props/targets.  At the moment, it requires an extra step outside of MSBuild to initialize for MSBuild.  It would be amazing if MSBuild could be the initializer as well.  \r\n\r\n###Proposal\r\nGiven a tool that can produces MSBuild target files, have MSBuild invoke it then either import it from Pipe or from a cached location. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Import Project=\"$(ProjectDir)\\Cache\\sdk.targets\" Execute=\"sdk.cmd -CreateTarget\" ProjectCached=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\n",
