  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe MSB4017 error is not consistently shown when a logger fails.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Update the BuildStartedHandler of ParallelConsoleLogger such that it thows an exception. For example, add a throw in [that line](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7b37a280a13c01bbaeeb39b9c018a5ac7a728898/src/Build/Logging/ParallelLogger/ParallelConsoleLogger.cs#L242). \r\n2. Run a build of some project. Console app will do. You will see the message along with details: stack trace and exception message.\r\n```\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB4017: The build stopped unexpectedly because of an unexpected logger failure.\r\nThis is an unhandled exception from a logger -- PLEASE OPEN A BUG AGAINST THE LOGGER OWNER.\r\n```\r\n3. Remove the previous code change and update instead the ProjectStartedHandler of ParallelConsoleLogger with some throw ([this line](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7b37a280a13c01bbaeeb39b9c018a5ac7a728898/src/Build/Logging/ParallelLogger/ParallelConsoleLogger.cs#L585)). \r\n4. Run build again. You will see only\r\n```\r\nMSBuild version 17.9.0-dev-23574-01+f4b2350ac for .NET Framework\r\nBuild started 11/24/2023 3:59:10 PM.\r\n```\r\n### \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect to see the error MSB4017 for any logger failure.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNo error MSB4017 in the second build. The log does not indicate anything about what happened and is confusing.\n\n### Analysis\n\nHere is the place where the error was considered benign, and the exception is not thrown up further: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7b37a280a13c01bbaeeb39b9c018a5ac7a728898/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L854\r\n\r\nSince customers may write their own logs, including ones that throw exceptions during events handlers, I would suggest address all exceptions that the loggers throw and, in all times, report the logger failure. \n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
