  "body": "\n### Context\n\nhttps://github.com/JanKrivanek/msbuild/blob/815eae8b904436885fc31ed3d1b89c7c5b89d9d4/documentation/specs/proposed/BuildCheck.md?plain=1#L185-L197\n\nWe sense that there will need to be a mechanism of distinguishing msbuild code that should be analyzed and code that should be ignored - and likely even on analyzer by analyzer basis.\n\nThe documentation contains some proposal of possible categorization and impact - but this is in need for revision.\n\n### Goals\n\n* Define categorization of msbuild code - so that we can clearly distinguish what should be analyzed and what not for particular categories. (the categorization should contain rules on how we distinguish for particular file in what category does it belong)\n* Decide whther this should be an 'inputs filtering' (filtering of data incomming to analyzers), 'reports filtering' or a combination\n* Decide on behavior of checks, that might involve multiple locations\ne.g. \"Property defined, but not used\" - what if property is defined in .csproj, but accessed in common targets (e.g. `$(TargetFramework)`)? Similarly we can have a check for unitialized property access - where read and write are in distinct files that would be categorized differently.",
