  "body": "Running CodeFormatter changed all our private field names (added _), and it looks like this could be a potentially serious issue since we're using binary serialization. The version we shipped with VS2015 did not have the CodeFormatter changes included.\n\nThere are a few places where MSBuild writes a cache file, this can be easily handled by adding a version  field and recreate the cache.\n\nI'm not sure about the impact of this across versions and SxS scenarios. There are unfortunetely code comments warning against this exact scenario (e.g. https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/1510d9a8cf346f01919c5b9545ef0b1a25bfbe9d/src/Framework/ExternalProjectFinishedEventArgs.cs).\n",
