Note that these are coming from different threads and slightly different time (2 seconds apart), but the same node, submission, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the targets in question are relatively new (added recently for cross-targeting?). Maybe CallTarget can result in this?",

I would expect that MSBuild handles these in a generic way.\r\nThis is the sample solution that reproduces this:\r\n[ReproDoubleBuild.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1108507/ReproDoubleBuild.zip)",
