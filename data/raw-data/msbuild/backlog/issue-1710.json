  "body": "Diagnostic builds log the current environment at the start of a build:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment at start of build:\r\nALLUSERSPROFILE                = C:\\ProgramData\r\nAPPDATA                        = C:\\Users\\davkean\\AppData\\Roaming\r\nCommonProgramFiles             = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\r\nCommonProgramFiles(x86)        = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\r\nCommonProgramW6432             = C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\r\nCOMPUTERNAME                   = DAVKEAN-DEV\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to diagnose builds, it would be really helpful if the set of global properties were also logged:\r\n```\r\nDesignTimeBuild                = true\r\nConfiguration                  = Debug\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would help diagnose both command-line and Visual Studio builds. As example, I'm trying to figure out https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues/1554, and I have no idea where to start - is this a CPS bug? Or a MSBuild bug? ",
