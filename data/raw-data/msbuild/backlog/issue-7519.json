  "title": "Multiple Copy into statements in script cause sql project to fail building",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nA SQL project fails to build if they are two \"copy into\" statements in a given script. The issue is seems to stem from the fact it cannot handle the WITH arguments if they are repeated. In this example, it will be FILE_TYPE.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nOpen the sql project zipped here and try to build. \r\n[bugtest.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/8419894/bugtest.zip)\r\n\r\nTo reproduce from scratch, create a SQL project with targetplatform Microsoft Azure SQL Datewarehouse (copy into is a synapse analytics feature) and add a new script with the following code\r\n[sp_MultipleCopyinto.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/8419907/sp_MultipleCopyinto.txt)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nTo build successfully\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nFailing with one error\r\n\"error MSB4018: The \"SqlBuildTask\" task failed unexpectedly.\"\r\n\"Error MSB4018: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: File_Type\"\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nEverything points to the inability of MSBuild to handle the with arguments. In the provided example FILE_TYPE is declared in the two copy into statement, leading to the error message above\r\nI would get the same error if I try to have defined FILE_FORMAT, CREDENTIAL, etc.. \r\nIf I only declare an argument once - example FILE_FORMAT in first copy into and CREDENTIAL in second copy into - then the issue disappears\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nTried with both Visual Studio (msbuild version 16.10.2+857e5a733) and Azure data studio with same result.\r\n\r\n",
