  "title": "Syntactic Sugar for Default Properties",
  "body": "A common pattern in MSBuild is to set a property only if it does not already have a value.\n\n``` xml\n<PropertyGroup>\n    <Foo Condition=\"'$(Foo)'==''\">A</Foo>\n    <Bar Condition=\"'$(Bar)'==''\">B</Bar>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\nAdding explicit syntactic sugar to support this pattern would dramatically improve readability.\n\nThis could be done with a DefaultProperties element that automatically treated the properties as if they had the condition checking for the empty value:\n\n``` xml\n<DefaultProperties>\n    <Foo>A</Foo>\n    <Bar>B</Bar>\n</DefaultProperties>\n```\n\nCombined with #820 this would simplify even further to\n\n``` xml\n<DefaultProperties\n    Foo=\"A\"\n    Bar=\"B\"\n/>\n```\n",
