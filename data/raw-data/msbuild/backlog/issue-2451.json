  "body": "I am trying to put .targets and .props files into the build directory of my NuGet package.  I know how to do this with a .nuspec file but I was hoping to do this in my MSBuild project file.\r\n\r\nI can find no documentation of how to do this but it appears to be done in the core-setup file [Microsoft.NETCore.App.pkgproj](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/master/src/pkg/projects/Microsoft.NETCore.App/Microsoft.NETCore.App.pkgproj).\r\n```\r\n    <File Include=\"$(PropsFile)\">\r\n      <TargetPath>build/$(NETCoreAppFramework)</TargetPath>\r\n    </File>\r\n```\r\nWhen I try to replicate the usage above, the build succeeds but the element is apparently ignored because no build directory exists in the NuGet package.  Is there some trick to using this?  Thanks for any guidance you can provide.  (My apologies in advance if this is a question best posed to the NuGet team. I have also asked them.)\r\n\r\n_**Version details:**\r\nMSBuild 15.3.409.57025\r\nNuGet 4.3.0.3\r\nVisual Studio 2017 (15.3.0 Preview 7.1)\r\nWindows 10.0.10586_",
