  "title": "[Bug]: VS and MSBuild/dotnet build produce behave differently with Build Dependencies",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nVS allows to have build dependencies, that allows to build additional projects next to the main project to ensure satellite projects are also built. This is especially necessary when a project is indirectly dependent on another project. Wheres a project references copy they output of the dependent project to the consuming project, build dependencies just build all dependent projects do not copy the output to the consuming/main projects.\r\n\r\nYou have to configure the build dependency in the solution.\r\n\r\nWhen building inside Visual Studio this behavior is correct. The projects are build and no dependencies are copied.\r\n\r\nWhen building with MSBuild/dotnet build dependencies are seen as project references, but not completely (only a few components are copied to the consuming project, but not the same way as having a real project reference).\r\n\r\nThis is especially a problem when people are using VS push their changes to the build agent and get a different behavior.\r\nIt took us quite a while to find out what the problem really was.\r\n\r\n#2274 seems to be related.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI have attached a demo example to reproduce the behavior.\r\n\r\n[Dependencies.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15815195/Dependencies.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n1. `Build Dependencies` should be seen as such and not as `Project Dependencies`\r\n2. All build tools should behave the same way.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n1. `Build Dependencies` are seen partly as  `Project Dependencies` (MSBuild/dotnet)\r\n2. Build tools behave differently on different tools\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nI don't know the details, but setting\r\n\r\n`<AddSyntheticProjectReferencesForSolutionDependencies>false</AddSyntheticProjectReferencesForSolutionDependencies>`\r\n\r\nseems to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n.NET 8 / Visual Studio 2022 17.11 (Preview 2)\r\nBut it does not seem to a problem of the preview.",
