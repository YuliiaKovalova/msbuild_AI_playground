But its content is duplicated when accessed in the Primary target.\r\n\r\nThe issue goes away if I remove the `Input` and `Output` attributes.\r\n\r\n_Issue.targets:_\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project DefaultTargets=\"Primary\">\r\n\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n        <InFiles Include=\"A.in;B.in\" />\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n    <Target Name=\"Primary\"\r\n            DependsOnTargets=\"Dependency\">\r\n        <Message Text=\"In Primary target.

OutFiles: A.out;B.out\r\n  In Primary target.    OutFiles: A.out;B.out\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n  In Dependency target. OutFiles: A.out;B.out\r\n  In Primary target.    OutFiles: A.out;B.out;A.out;B.out\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nmsbuild.exe\r\n- Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 17.3.0-preview-22277-01+f1dae6ab6 for .NET Framework  \r\n    17.3.0.27701\r\n\r\ndotnet.exe\r\n- 6.0.400-preview.22301.10",

But that's not the case; the list is only ever doubled, even when there are more `InFiles` items, and we don't see the log message from inside `Dependency` more than once.",
