  "body": "Define a new [node type](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/09bdfae164eac3b5c9027d803ffa513efaf91095/src/MSBuild/CommandLineSwitches.cs#L242) and plumb it through. When the new node type is launched, the MSBuild process initializes itself and is ready to accept build requests. A specific build request can be hard-coded for testing for now. The process exits after a configurable timeout, initially equivalent to the worker node timeout.\r\n\r\nAcceptance criteria: MSBuild can be launched with the new `/nodemode`, perform a sample build request, and exits after a timeout.",
