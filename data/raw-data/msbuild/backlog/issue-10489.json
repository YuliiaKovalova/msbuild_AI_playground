  "title": "[BuildCheck Suggestion]: Enable static graph",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nMSBuild has the opt-in [static graph](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/static-graph.md) evaluation model.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense to add a BuildCheck to tell users to opt-in to this mode.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nThe [static graph spec](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/static-graph.md) explains the benefits of the static graph model. It seems that the eventual desire is to move the ecosystem towards static graph evaluation, but that backwards compatibility prevents changing the default.\r\n\r\nThe BuildCheck provides a way to allow projects to migrate to static graph over time and gain momentum.\n\n### Sample issue or antipattern that the check should be flagging\n\nAny invocation of MSBuild without the `-graph` parameter could / should be flagged.\n\n### Sample output\n\n_No response_",
