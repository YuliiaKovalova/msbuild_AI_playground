If this is a cross-plat build - or if you know of some other reason that those '/' would be showing up in the path - that would be useful to mention.  (If that is the case, I'm afraid I'm not aware of whether / how well the C++ build system supports cross-plat.) \n\nSince you mention that a local build by logging onto the machine is successful, the next debugging step I'd recommend is getting a diagnostic build log of both a local build that succeeds and a Jenkins build that fails, and dig through the logs to see whether there are any interesting differences.  (e.g. does the local build try to write the above .lastbuildstate file somewhere else?  If so, why?) \n\nAlso, as a general note, it's helpful to call out which version of MSBuild you're using, as that can also sometimes make a difference.  In this case, given that the error message mentions the VS 2013 C++ targets, I assume that you are using MSBuild 12?  \n",
