Continuously FI after 2.\r\n- [x] 4. Build Full Framework flavor in xplat CI\r\n- [x] 5. Enable and fix FF & tests (all tests that currently pass in master)\r\n- [x] 6. Audit the code diff\r\n- [x] 8. Migrate / handle internal test collateral associated with MSBuild\r\n\r\nLong term goal, assigning to distant future. This is something we want to do, but not something we have the time for right now. \r\n\r\n.NET Core features turned on/off based on configurations. OS specific behavior should be adjusted at runtime.\r\n",

It would still be really great if we had a clear explanation of what worked in the different versions of MSBuild.",
