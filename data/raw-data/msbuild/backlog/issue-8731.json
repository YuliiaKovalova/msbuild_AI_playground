  "title": "[Bug]: Core version of RAR fails to read WinRT runtime version from assemblies",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe non-Framework / non-Windows implementation of RAR has a bug where it incorrectly assumes that the metadata version - referred to as \"runtime version\" in the code - has to start with 'v'. Metadata version of WinRT files looks like `WindowsRuntime 1.4` or `WindowsRuntime 1.4;CLR v4.0.30319`.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a WinRT component using the Windows Runtime Component template in VS and add it as a reference to a .NET project. Build the project.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12206368/236165010-cb2bdcbb-61d2-4f2c-a93e-ab5f3ab25c5e.png)\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12206368/236165999-8ea96ebd-ba04-416d-88ee-d2cf5d7932a2.png)\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nHere's the bug:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/6882ab9de1c4d5786e14370b0b123c78cae3a671/src/Tasks/AssemblyDependency/AssemblyInformation.cs#L1051-L1056\r\n\r\nIt's not clear what the downstream effect is. Since .winmd's cannot be referenced by modern .NET projects anyway - the build errors out in the `CheckForUnsupportedWinMDReferences` task - it is possible that this part of Core RAR may be deleted.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild version 17.6.0-preview-23174-01+e7de13307 for .NET",
