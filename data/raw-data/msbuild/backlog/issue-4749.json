  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nAttached a rather simple project.\r\n[WindowsFormsCore.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/files/3632415/WindowsFormsCore.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nCompile the project should be successful.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nCompilation failed with,\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Preview\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Microsoft.CSharp.CurrentVersion.targets(100,9): error MSB3041: Unable to create a manifest resource name for \"Test\\Form1.resx\". Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\lextm\\source\\repos\\WindowsFormsCore\\WindowsFormsCore\\Test\\Test\\Form1.cs'.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\nIt started to happen in .NET Core 3.0 SDK Preview 9 (RC1 still has this issue).\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.0 SDK Preview 8 and earlier seem to be OK.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nMove all files of Form1 to the root directory of that project, and the compilation error disappears. However, many existing projects should already have such folders to organize their forms/user controls, so applying this workaround will be painful.\r\n",
