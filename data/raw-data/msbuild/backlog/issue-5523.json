        "body": "Just wanted to add some clarity about why we are moving the MSBuild GitHub repo to the the dotnet organization: \r\n\r\n* MSBuild is written in .NET and a large chunk of its features are rooted deeply in the .NET ecosystem\r\n* Most consumers & contributors are from the .NET ecosystem\r\n* It\u2019s been a .NET Foundation project since 2017so the dotnet org is a logical location\r\n\r\nWe know that that folks use MSBuild for things other than .NET. The move to the .NET Foundation does not represent any change in focus C++ remains a first class citizen for MSBuild. \r\n\r\nThe new link will be `https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild`\r\n\r\nKathleen Dollard\r\nMSBuild PM",
