  "title": "(Re)enable building debug symbols using Mono debug format",
  "body": "Related to #459, from discussion in #462, it sounds like we may want to continue to support `.mdb` symbol creation, depending on Mono needs. Those symbol files were semi-supported with 658fc55 which detected them with \n\n```\nCondition=\"'$(OS)' != 'Windows_NT' and '$(OutputType)' != 'winmdobj' and '@(_DebugSymbolsIntermediatePath)' == ''\"\n```\n\nIdeally, we would try to copy around `.dll.mdb` files when they will be produced (when we're using the Mono `mcs` compiler and it's configured to emit symbols, regardless of host OS).\n",
