  "body": "Since Visual Studio 2010, vcbuild has been replaced by msbuild.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a big difference between vcbuild and msbuild on handling errors over project dependencies.\r\n\r\nI have two visual studio projects:\r\n  - Project A having a file which doesn't compile,\r\n  - Project B.\r\n\r\nI have a visual studio solution which contains those two projects. I set a project dependency to have B that depends on A. The build order would be A, B.\r\n\r\nWith the following command: vcbuild test.sln \"Debug|Win32\"\r\n  - Project A starts to compile and fails showing errors,\r\n  - After that, Project B starts to compile.\r\n\r\nWith the following command: msbuild test.sln /target:Build /property:Configuration=Debug /property:Platform=Win32\r\n  - Project A starts to compile and fails showing errors,\r\n  - No compilation is done on Project B.\r\n\r\nmsbuild doesn't continue to compile the projects of the solution when a project fails. This is quite annoying. I've tried to use the following msbuild options: ContinueOnError=true or StopOnFirstFailure=false. They are not taken into account for building the solution.\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround to be able to use msbuild with this behavior (ie vcbuild behavior)?\r\n",
