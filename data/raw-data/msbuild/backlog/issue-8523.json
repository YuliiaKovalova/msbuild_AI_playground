  "title": "ProjectInstance should allow a way to specify Interactive",
  "body": "NuGet's static graph-based restore is using the `ProjectInstance.FromFile()` method to create an instance of a `ProjectInstance`.  However, there is no way to specify the `Interactive` flag in any public constructor.  `internal` and `private` constructors derive this flag from the `BuildParameters` but there is no public constructor that accepts a `BuildParameters` object either.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Console/MSBuildStaticGraphRestore.cs#L929\r\n\r\nThis leads to static graph-restore not being able to set the `Interactive` flag so then restores can fail in certain cases when the configured credential provider needs to prompt the user for authentication.\r\n\r\nI think the `ProjectOptions` class should just have a `Interactive` property which gets plumbed through.\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n* Have a set of projects that reference NuGet-based MSBuild project SDKs and package references\r\n* Configure a feed that requires authentication (like Azure DevOps Artifacts)\r\n* Configure a credential provider that will get an authentication token via a prompt (like the Azure Artifacts Credential Provider)\r\n* Enable static graph-based restores via `/p:RestoreUseStaticGraphEvaluation=true`\r\n* Restore\r\n\r\nThis has been a problem for a few years but only recently did I have enough time to figure out why.\r\n\r\n/cc @dfederm ",

        "body": "Since BuildParameters itself is public, and Interactive is a public property on BuildParameters, I was hopeful it might suffice to have BeginBuild(BuildParameters) start by tweaking _interactive, but it doesn't look like that's sufficient because ProjectInstance.FromFile itself calls Evaluate with the wrong Interactive value. My only real concern with tweaking ProjectOptions to have a (public) Interactive property is that since it isn't sealed, people might theoretically be extending it. It should be ok as long as we make it default to false, though.\r\n\r\nSince you self-assigned this, I'm guessing you want to work on it?",
