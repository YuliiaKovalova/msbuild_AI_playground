  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWriteCodeFragment pretty directly calls File.WriteAllText, which fails if you pass in a folder structure that does not exist. We should consider calling Directory.CreateDirectory first.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nTake any project and add a call to the WriteCodeFragment task, passing in `OutputDirectory=<path on computer that does not exist>`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCreates folders as necessary\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nFails\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n_No response_",
