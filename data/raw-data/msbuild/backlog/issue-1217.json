It is only useful to someone authoring or modifying the build process. We should relegate this to more verbose logs by logging them with `MessageImportance.Low` instead of `MessageImportance.Normal`. \n\nI think this is just a mistake on my part many years ago and would do no harm to tweak now. I can do a PR if you like.\n",
