  "body": "A quick fix is to move the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers` line here into the earlier itemgroup:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/15e80d52df3e877e5e9c5df6c3e2df65bf81873f/eng/Packages.props#L46-L53\r\n\r\nBannedApiAnalyzers has some intentional old dependencies and it's not feasible to build it during source-build. It's already been removed from source-build and we need to remove usages. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/issues/5619\r\n\r\nBannedApiAnalyzers isn't one of the analyzers that ends up in the SDK product, so the only reason for source-build to build it is for code validation parity when building MSBuild's C# source code. That would help source-build developers write upstreamable code if the MSBuild C# code needs to be patched, but dev flows aren't the primary goal of source-build right now.",
