  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nReplaying ToolsRestore.binlog from our pipeline leads to an error (e.g.: [ToolsetRestore.binlog from build](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/_apis/resources/Containers/15003300/PostBuildLogs?itemPath=PostBuildLogs%2FPublish_Artifacts_Logs%2FToolsetRestore.binlog), [ToolsetRestore.binlog copied to SharePoint](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:u:/t/ManagedLanguagesIDE/EaWnxaUjbU9HjmD0yxiJkGwB_S-U-4or384dgqGd3P49YA?e=Ua87Ua)(in case the build expires)):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet build .\\ToolsetRestore.binlog\r\nMSBuild version 17.8.0-preview-23367-03+0ff2a83e9 for .NET\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild succeeded.\r\n    0 Warning(s)\r\n    0 Error(s)\r\n\r\nTime Elapsed 00:00:01.30\r\nThere was an exception while reading the log file: One of the identified items was in an invalid format.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there is either en issue with producing the log (more likely) or reading - any of which should be fixed.\r\nThe binlog reader doesn't report issues opening such file.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThis is yielding current binlog redacting PoC uncapable to process such a logs - so at least the culprit should be known",
