  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nSetup for our tool is built on teamcity using wix toolset with FAKE scripts for preparing the environment.\r\nAfter updating FAKE in context of teamcity, Msbuild now gets this flag by default which didn't exist before: \r\nclp:ForceConsoleColor\r\nAnd it seems that this freezes the wix build at one point.\r\nWhen this flag is removed, setup is built successfully.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when the flag is used, gibberish is shown in the console output.\r\nIt can be also reproduced if called from Command Prompt, teamcity doesn't have to be used.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of corrupted output.\r\n```C\r\nBuild started 12.10.2018. 14:00:46.\r\n\u001b[36;1mProject \"D:\\\\<somefolder>\\\\MyBundle.sln\" on node 1 (Rebuild target(s)).\r\n\u001b[m\u001b[30;1m\u001b[36;1mValidateSolutionConfiguration:\r\n\u001b[30;1m  Building solution configuration \"Release|x64\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommand line\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\user>\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\"  \"D:\\<somefolder>\\MyBundle.sln\" \"/t:Rebuild\" \"/m:1\" \"/nodeReuse:False\" \"/v:n\" \"/clp:ForceConsoleColor\" \"/p:RestorePackages=False\" \"/p:Optimize=True\" \"/p:DebugSymbols=True\" \"/p:Configuration=Release\" \"/p:Platform=x64\"\r\n```\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nNew flags shouldn't break the build.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nclp:ForceConsoleColor freezes the build and outputs broken text (check example above).\r\nAs soon as the flag is removed, build works again.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.8.169+g1ccb72aefa for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

        "body": "The \"broken\" text is the documented behavior of that switch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                        ForceConsoleColor--Use ANSI console colors even if\r\n                            console does not support it\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Windows console doesn't use ANSI color codes (normally; this is changing with the latest win10 updates), so they just get passed through as gibberish.\r\n\r\nI don't know why FAKE would opt into this mode by default. It looks like you filed that at https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE/issues/2146. It was added for UNIX-like environments that _do_ support colorization but are getting misdetected for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nI'd also be fairly surprised if the console logging output was causing the build hang. Can you remove the `ForceConsoleColor` while keeping the updated everything else to isolate the cause there?",

It seems that it get stuck on one of the candle steps.\r\nOn Monday I might give you more info when I get to work.",
