  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to run custom builds steps in parallel (C++ VS 2019 16.2). It seems that parallel execution is switched off when those custom build steps inputs depend on another custom build steps output, as stated in the log file:\r\n```\r\n\"The build of 'SomeHeader.h' depends on 'OtherHeader.h' which is produced by the build of 'some_other_gen_file'. The items cannot be built in parallel.\"\r\n```\r\nIn the project I have around 20x `SomeHeader.h` type of build steps and they all rely on this one file 'OtherHeader.h', so we don't get any benefit from using BuildInParallel for those tasks.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to make them run in parallel ?\r\n\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.2.32702+c4012a063 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
