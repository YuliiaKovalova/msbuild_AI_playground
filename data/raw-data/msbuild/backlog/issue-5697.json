  "body": "As a potential perf optimization, change the [sdk resolver interface ](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/tree/master/src/Framework/Sdk) to allow passing the evaluation's [file system cache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/FileSystem/MSBuildFileSystemBase.cs) to each resolver.\r\n\r\nIf the sdk resolvers do IO for every resolve call (from a super brief glance over them they do), this would allow them to reuse the same IO cache as the evaluator. This further gets enhanced when other tools are driving evaluation (VS, quickbuild) and are using a shared evaluation context.",
