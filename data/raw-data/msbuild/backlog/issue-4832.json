  "body": "When hitting Ctrl-C during a build, if a child tool was terminated by MSBuild as part of cancelation, you will get something like\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Professional\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VC\\v160\\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(1235,5): error MSB6006: \"Lib.exe\" exited with code -1073741510. [C:\\git\\coreclr\\bin\\obj\\Windows_NT.x64.Release\\src\\vm\r\n\\crossgen\\cee_crossgen.vcxproj]\r\n```\r\n-1073741510. of course is 0xC000013A: STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT\r\n\r\nSince this is \"by design\" (MSBuild working properly) perhaps this code could special case it and give a message like `error MSB6006: \"Lib.exe\" exited because it was canceled` which looks less like something different went wrong during cancelation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/b2db71bebaae4f54f7236ca303e2b0a14aca1a0d/src/Utilities/ToolTask.cs#L383-L386",
