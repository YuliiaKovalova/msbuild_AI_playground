  "body": "_From @faniereynders on July 26, 2018 8:49_\n\nGiven the following `ItemGroup` in a project file:\r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"11.0.2\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\Foo\\Foo.csproj\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\nJust like package references are resolved by ID, it would be cool to introduce a shorthand for project references. Instead of referencing a project by path, reference it by name:\r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"11.0.2\" />\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"Foo\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\nThe example above will try to resolve `Foo.csproj` or `Foo.fsproj` etc. from folders within the solution scope. This will allow one to specify a project reference by name instead of path.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts about this?\r\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/sdk#2432_",

In large repos, having multiple solutions (each for a slice of the repo) is quite common.\r\n\r\nThat means that it's not possible to find the \"right\" solution to associate with a project given only the project as an entry point, for instance if you build with `msbuild path\\to\\a.csproj`.",
