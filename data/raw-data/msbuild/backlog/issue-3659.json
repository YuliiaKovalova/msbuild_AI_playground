  "body": "I'm writing a small tool to visualize node usage during the build from binlog.\r\n\r\nI find that sometimes a project may yield a node when:\r\n1. It starts to build a project reference and waits for the finish.\r\n2. Some tasks which take a long time may call IBuildEngine3.Yield.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we can have an event for yielding node so that we are sure what is happening.\r\n\r\nBTW, can we also know whether an MSBuild task is for project reference or not?\r\nWhat is the common scenario when a project starts an MSBuild task?\r\nWhat kind of information in binlog can I use to defer what it is doing?\r\nCurrently I treat MSBuild task as a black box :-).",
