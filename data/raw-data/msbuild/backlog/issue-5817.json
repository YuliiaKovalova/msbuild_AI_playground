When trying to build MSBuild, be sure to run `build.cmd` on the command line first.\r\n\r\nCheck out areas within XmlPoke (like [this one](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Tasks/XmlPoke.cs#L106)) that have instances of using DtdProcessing and see what it is set to. All instances should be set to DtdProcessing.Prohibit.\r\n\r\nYou can do the same with [XslTransformation](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Tasks/XslTransformation.cs#L222) and [XmlPeek](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Tasks/XmlPeek.cs#L214)\r\n\r\nThanks for taking this on, and feel free to ask many questions!",
