  "title": "transitive properties and dependencies",
  "body": "One of the more reasons why meta-build systems are required over msbuild - and that's only papered-over by using complex add-ons like NuGet - is the inability for a project to set transitive properties.\n\nFor instance, if I have a project called **A** that creates a static library `a.lib` in `Release/A/Debug` and puts its header files in `source/include/a` and then also have a project called **B** that depends upon **A**, it is generally required to add `a.lib` to **B**'s library inputs, add `Release/A/Debug` to **B**'s library locations, and add 'source/include/a' to **B**'s include directories. This extends to libraries that **A** might depend on; at most we have ways for **B** to pull in all of **A**'s dependencies (Use Dependent Libraries) or none of them, but not a selective list.\n\nThere is currently no direct way to express this in MSBuild. At best, **A** can offer some kind of `a.props` file, but adding **A** as a reference to **B** will not automatically pull in that props file. Worse, the props file includes are all by-path so if you end up renaming or moving **A** you'll break **B** in multiple ways, making such maintenance unnecessarily burdensome.\n\nAt the very least, a way for a project to specify a props file to be used by referencees would be handy, if not a more complete way of specifying private and public properties.\n\nEssentially, this bug is asking for CMake's `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, and `INTERFACE` attribute visibility in MSBuild itself.\n",
