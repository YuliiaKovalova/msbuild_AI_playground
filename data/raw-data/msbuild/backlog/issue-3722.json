  "body": "#### Background\r\nMy harddrive died so I had to reinstall everything including Visual Studio and the msbuild project, when I was installing VS I thought I don't need `.NET Framework v3.5` so I unchecked it.\r\n\r\nAnd `msbuild.cmd` failed because of MSB3645, where the v3.5 SDK is needed. I tried to re-install the SDK using VS installer, but then it reported `MSBuild.exe` is in use.\r\n\r\nI wonder if MSBuild may have gotten left running after the build script failed, so I tested it and this seems to happen consistently.\r\n\r\n__I thought I was done__, but as I was going to verify this issue for a clean run (run script without error), turns out the MSBuild processes did not shutdown even when the build succeeded.\r\n\r\nIs this normal or expected?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run `Build.cmd` from Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017.\r\n1. Expect it to fail due to `error MSB3645: .NET Framework v3.5 Service Pack 1 was not found.`\r\n1. Close the command prompt and open up Task Manager to verify `MSBuild.exe` is Running\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior (?)\r\n`MSBuild.exe` should not appear in task manager as Running after `Build.cmd` finished running (?)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n`MSBuild.exe` is up and running.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### OS info:\r\n`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.254]`\r\n`Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017\r\nVersion 15.8.3`\r\n`Microsoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.7.03056`\r\n",
