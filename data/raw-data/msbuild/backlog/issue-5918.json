The second time CreatePackage runs it clashes because the output is already open by the first instance of the project running.\r\n\r\nIf everything I believe in is correct the project shouldn't build it's default targets again since it is already being built the first time. How are there two builds of this project? The timeline view confirms that they run concurrently:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/679326/100534446-b7fb1000-31c3-11eb-8787-97006d280b51.png)\r\n\r\nThe actual error I'm getting is:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\kirill\\.nuget\\packages\\nuget.build.packaging\\0.2.2\\build\\NuGet.Build.Packaging.targets(377,3): The process cannot access the file 'C:\\CPS\\bin\\Debug\\packages\\nuget\\Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.16.8.368-pre-gdb101be19c.nupkg' because it is being used by another process.
