  "body": "### Summary\n\nWe should warn when an `Exec` task is used to spawn a new build via `dotnet build`, `dotnet publish`, etc.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nIt's usually a bad pattern to run `dotnet build`, `dotnet publish`, etc from an `Exec` task, since this spawns an entirely separate build that the MSBuild engine doesn't have visibility over.  We should recommend using an `MSBuild` task instead.\n\n### Sample issue or antipattern that the check should be flagging\n\n```xml\n  <Target Name=\"BuildVer2022\">\n    <Exec Command=\"dotnet build -p:C3DVersion=Ver2022 -c $(Configuration)\"/>\n  </Target>\n```\n\nSource: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/45034#issuecomment-2533710620\n\n### Sample output\n\n_No response_",

I have solution-level MSBuild code in which `<Target Name=\"Restore\">` runs `nuget restore` on such web sites.  I don't agree that MSBuild should warn about this use.",
