Note that under the path to 64-bit MSBuild there is not the assembly Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence.dll and then the issue occurs.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ef774d-be57-4329-8b1b-0c577e764ecc)\n\nRegarding the test that couldn't catch the regression, it's because the msbuildExe path used in the test is the build output folder of the test project and this folder contains the assembly Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence.dll. The package reference [Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7ad4e1c76585d0ed6e438da2d4f9394326934399/src/Build/Microsoft.Build.csproj#L33) in ./src/Build/Microsoft.Build.csproj is transitively copied to the build output of the test project.\n\nWe need to change the test to use msbuildExe in the boostrap and make sure 64-bit msbuild there doesn't contain the assembly Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence.dll.",
