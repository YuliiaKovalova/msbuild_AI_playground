  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI was doing some PerfView digging and noticed that these Start/Stop events always log project paths for MSBuild-repo projects instead of the names of the projects actually being built. This seems less than helpful for triage purposes.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nGet an ETL trace that enables the `Microsoft-Build` provider and look at the `Microsoft-Build/BuildProject/Start` and `Microsoft-Build/BuildProject/Stop` events.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI can look for start/stop events for the single project I own that I'm building.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe start/stop events' projectPath keys all have MSBuild paths:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f1b6f50-caba-4169-acd3-1db939861c02)\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe logging line is https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/84edf6ca8701dad6f214d15584165430f1adac8f/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L1122, which at a glance seems reasonable, but maybe we have some bug in the tracking?\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
