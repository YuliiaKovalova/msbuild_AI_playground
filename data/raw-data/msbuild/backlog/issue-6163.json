The documentation on the site should match the documentation on `msbuild -?`.\r\n\r\nPassing -nowarn sets warnings as messages (the same as passing -warnasmessage), which explains why passing ErrorsOnly silences most of your output. Unfortunately there isn't a clearer way of achieving this today.",
