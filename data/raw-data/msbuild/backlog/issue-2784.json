The import looks like so: `<Import Project=\"$(SolutionDir)..\\foo\\bar.targets\" />`\r\n\r\nThis results in a build-time error when using msbuild to restore nuget packages via command line:\r\n\r\nC:\\SolutionDirRepro\\SolutionDirRepro.csproj(139,3): error MSB4019: The imported project \"C:\\SolutionDirRepro\\*Undefined*..\\foo\\test.targets\" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.\r\n\r\nIf I move the .targets file to the directory the solution resides in, this problem goes away.",
