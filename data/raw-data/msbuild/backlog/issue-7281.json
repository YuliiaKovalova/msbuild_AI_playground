  "title": "Build performance degradation from switch to sdk format normal?",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn the perspective of switching to .net6, I was planning to switch our dotnetframework build files to the new sdk format, using try-convert and then sometimes having to manually change some stuff.\r\nHowever on my machine the build time of the sdk is reasonably slower (went from about 11:00-11:30 to 12:40-13:10). Is this to be expected? \r\n\r\nI did do the new builds with the newer msbuild 17.0.0+c9eb9dd64 (visualstudio 17.0), compared to the old 16.7.0+b89cb5fdeI (visual studio 16.7.5) was using for the old format build. The target is still net471 for now as I just wanted to see if the framework build was working with the sdk before trying to update to net6.\r\n\r\nI tried to look through the diagnostic logging+binlog, but I wasn't seeing anything that was helping me get a clue on what is slowing it down.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe performance metrics at the end of the diagnostic logging weren't really helping me, at first I thought it was an issue of sgen being slower (for some reason that task took 3:40 min on one project compared to 12 sec in the old build, but removing the sgen from that project didn't impact overall slowdown at all so that wasn't it).\r\nThe perf metrics for the sdk build:\r\n[newloggingperf.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/7857231/newloggingperf.txt)\r\nThe perf metrics for the old format build:\r\n[oldloggingperf.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/7857232/oldloggingperf.txt)\r\n\r\nI also have some binlog files to compare, as well as the files with diagnostic logging, but I'm hesitant about posting them publically(I'd have to ask someone higher up to give me the go-ahead for that first).\r\n\r\nI know that this isn't much to go on just yet (as I don't have a minimal repro as I don't quite know what the culprit is), but I'm hoping you can guide me where to look for the issue. \r\n\r\nkind regards\r\n",
