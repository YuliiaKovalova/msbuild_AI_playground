  "title": "[Feature Request]: Handle custom targets in `dotnet build -tl`",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\n`dotnet build -tl` is currently unable to report output of custom targets that are part of a project. It would be great if we could get any kind of information of what is currently being executed instead of being left in the dark.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nI have a project which does a handful of things in `PreBuild` and `PostBuild` targets. These commands' (`Exec`) output are displayed when using `dotnet build`, but are entirely omitted when using `dotnet build -tl`, instead only showing `MyProject PreBuild (0.0s)`.\r\n\r\nI would like to get progress reports on my commands. Some of them are `dotnet publish` commands for Native AOT, which I would like to monitor.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nSomething akin to the following output should be enough (taking the previous `dotnet publish` example):\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyProject PreBuild (0.0s)\r\n  -> Generating native code...\r\n```\r\n```\r\nMyProject PreBuild (0.0s)\r\n  -> Creating library /path/to/artifacts/MyProject.NAOT.lib and object /path/to/artifacts/MyProject.NAOT.exp...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n_No response_",

        "body": "This is a general problem that we need to address with TL. We can't allow as much output as the 'normal' console logger or else we lose all of the benefit of TL, but we clearly can't just use the `High` message priority because folks clutter that up quite easily as well. We need a principled way to determine what should be output and when. How would you feel if at maximum one or two lines of output were shown as part of the 'in-progress' portion of the display, even if none of that output made it to the 'summary' portion of the display (what's shown when the project is done building)?",

MSBuild can only understand what's going on if it can see what's going on, and if it's a separate build process, the only way we can see that is stdout piped into messages.",

You can check out the full docs for it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-task?view=vs-2022) if you'd like.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, there are subtle differences between `dotnet publish` and calling the `Publish` target directly - can I ask more about the scenario you're driving MSBuild invocations like this for? Do you have some kind of packaging/meta-project whose main responsibility is to script/orchestrate some kind of packaging?",
