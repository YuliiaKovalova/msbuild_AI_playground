  "body": "### Background \r\n #6215\r\n This subitem is focused on unit tests calling `TranslateDotNet` (to test de/serialization of exceptions and ProfilerResult)\r\n Since this is non-shipping code, it's not a priority. However it should be easy to get rid of it and so completely remove `TranslateDotnet`\r\n\r\n### Suggested approach\r\nUnit tests testing exceptions serialization should be moved to the new exception serialization mechanism (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/8786), or removed if redundand\r\nProfilerResult - most likely just remove, as this most likely uses only ITranslatable",
