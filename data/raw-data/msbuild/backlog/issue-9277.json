  "title": "[Bug] [Flaky test]: TestBuildWithChildren unit test is unreliable and may fail on an apparent race condition",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe `Microsoft.Build.UnitTests.BackEnd.BuildRequestEngine_Tests.TestBuildWithChildren` unit test failed in a PR build with an the following assert:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssert.Equal() Failure\r\nExpected: Active\r\nActual: Idle\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe location of the error is src\\Build.UnitTests\\BackEnd\\BuildRequestEngine_Tests.cs:line 408\r\n\r\nA subsequent build, different only by a change to a comment, succeeded.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nRun the set of unit tests.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a threading race condition and the test doesn't always break.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe unit test should be reliable and test what it is intended to test.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe unit test may fail while creating the conditions for the test.\n\n### Analysis\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/0bc63232987f0ec93e275104f3ba015ddc609af9/src/Build.UnitTests/BackEnd/BuildRequestEngine_Tests.cs#L399-L409\r\n\r\nThe code assumes that after the `Thread.Sleep(250)` at line 407, the engine status will be `Active`. Instead, the engine status may be `Idle`. There is a second instance of calling `Thread.Sleep()` and `VerifyEngineStatus()` later in the test method.\r\n\r\nSleeping for an arbitrary time and then assuming a certain state is inherently risky. Can this test be implemented without using `Thread.Sleep()`?\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild version 17.9.0-dev-23476-01+abb507c0a for .NET\r\n17.9.0.47601",
