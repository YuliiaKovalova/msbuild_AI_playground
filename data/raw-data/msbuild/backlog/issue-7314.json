Multi-threaded approach reduces unnecessary process initialization, complexity and increases build performance.\r\n- Needle moving (perf) - We estimate shaving >1 second off a non-trivial cold build even on the beefiest build machine due to the reduction of processes that have to be started, and ~5-10% of wall clock time savings in all builds.",
