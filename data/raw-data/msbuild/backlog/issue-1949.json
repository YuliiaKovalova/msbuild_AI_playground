  "title": "Add auto-imported Directory.build.props/targets to $(MSBuildAllProjects) automatically",
  "body": "`Directory.build.props`/`.targets` is a great feature, but when you start to add configuration properties in there and don't really know much about how incremental build works in msbuild, you're going to hit \"weird issues\".\r\nI'd like the auto-imported files to be automatically added to `$(MSBuildAllProjects)` so that targets using it as inputs will pick up changes automatically. It's easy to forget the [necessary preamble](https://github.com/dasMulli/dotnet-win32-service/blob/e93e0f7b42c056bbb81db84a7d87d7d65f3579ae/Directory.build.props#L3-L5) when you start out with an empty msbuild file.. Also, this helps reducing your project build files to the absolute minimum.",
