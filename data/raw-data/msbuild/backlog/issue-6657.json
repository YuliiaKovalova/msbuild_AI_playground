Seemingly since upgrading to .NET 5, my builds occasionally hang on the build server.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nTrimming my invocations to the most important parts:\r\n```\r\n> /usr/bin/dotnet publish /mnt/agent/work/63014a48ec1fbe46/source/Nuke.MSBuildTasks/Nuke.MSBuildTasks.csproj --configuration Release --framework net472 --no-build --verbosity Minimal --nologo \r\n> /usr/bin/dotnet publish /mnt/agent/work/63014a48ec1fbe46/source/Nuke.GlobalTool/Nuke.GlobalTool.csproj --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp2.1 --no-build --verbosity Minimal --nologo\r\n> /usr/bin/dotnet publish /mnt/agent/work/63014a48ec1fbe46/source/Nuke.GlobalTool/Nuke.GlobalTool.csproj --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp3.1 --no-build --verbosity Minimal --nologo\r\n> /usr/bin/dotnet publish /mnt/agent/work/63014a48ec1fbe46/source/Nuke.GlobalTool/Nuke.GlobalTool.csproj --configuration Release --framework net5.0 --no-build --verbosity Minimal --nologo\r\n> /usr/bin/dotnet publish /mnt/agent/work/63014a48ec1fbe46/source/Nuke.MSBuildTasks/Nuke.MSBuildTasks.csproj --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp2.1 --no-build --verbosity Minimal --nologo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nBuild should not hang, and at least give some kind of error output.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nBuild hangs. See one of my [GitHubActions run](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/actions/runs/985502119) where Windows and Linux succeed, while MacOS hangs.\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\nThe parallel `dotnet publish` never made any issues before, but maybe it wasn't a good idea after all ?",
