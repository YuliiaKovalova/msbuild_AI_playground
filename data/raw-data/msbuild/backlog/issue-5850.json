  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nIt appears that our usage of `BuildEngine.LogCustomEvent()` causes Xamarin.Android builds to hang when running on .NET 5. We are currently working toward Android support in .NET 6.\r\n\r\nI originally thought [Xamarin.Build.AsyncTask](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Build.AsyncTask) was at fault. But then I attached a debugger and saw weird behavior after the first `LogCustomEvent()` call. After this I was seeing `Log.LogMessage()` calls go through that did not appear in the MSBuild log output. I even saw `Execute()` return successfully, but the build appears to be stuck at this point. There still may be something we are doing wrong in [Xamarin.Build.AsyncTask](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Build.AsyncTask), let me know.\r\n\r\nWe can comment out all the `LogCustomEvent()` calls to fix the issue. It also appears to work fine on .NET framework and Mono.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUse this project on the `dotnet-build-hang` branch, and follow the installation instructions on the README:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xamarin/net6-samples/tree/dotnet-build-hang\r\n\r\nRun this command with an Android emulator or device attached:\r\n\r\n    dotnet build -t:Install .\\UnnamedProject\\UnnamedProject.csproj -v:diag\r\n\r\nRemoving `-v:diag` also solves the issue as well.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`dotnet build` completes.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`dotnet build` will block indefinitely. Ctrl+C does not stop either, you will need to kill the process.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed that may/may not be related is that `dotnet build` uses the `-distributedlogger` switch:\r\n\r\n    -distributedlogger:Microsoft.DotNet.Tools.MSBuild.MSBuildLogger,C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.100-rtm.20509.5\\dotnet.dll*Microsoft.DotNet.Tools.MSBuild.MSBuildForwardingLogger,C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.100-rtm.20509.5\\dotnet.dll\"\r\n\r\nWhile .NET framework MSBuild doesn't use this at all.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n```\r\n> dotnet msbuild /version\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.8.0-preview-20475-05+aed5e7ed0 for .NET\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n16.8.0.47505\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows 10 1903\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n\r\n`.binlog` is not very useful as I had to kill the process, I used `-flp:Verbosity=diag` to get more info:\r\n\r\n[logs.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/5478365/logs.zip)",
