  "title": "Support wildcard patterns matching folders starting with \".\" without matching items with relative paths outside of the project folder",
  "body": "In the .NET SDK, we'd like to automatically exclude folders such as `.vs` and `.git` from items such as `Compile` and `Content`.  I tried doing this by having the equivalent of the following in the .targets files:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Compile Remove=\"**/.*/**\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this ended up matching and thus removing items in relative folders outside the project root, for example `..\\Shared\\Shared.cs`.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a way to express a wildcard that matches folder names starting with \".\", but doesn't match the relative portions (\"..\") of paths.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple repro project: [RelativeWildcard.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/662480/RelativeWildcard.zip)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project DefaultTargets=\"Build\">\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <Compile Include=\"**\\*.cs\" />\r\n    <Compile Include=\"..\\Shared\\**\\*.cs\" />\r\n    <Compile Remove=\"**/.*/**\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n    <Message Text=\"@(Compile)\" />\r\n  </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n```",

Not sure how to get around this, maybe the `.` and `..` directories could be explicitly excluded from matches? Any solution is going to be a breaking change, but that's likely justifiable here.",
