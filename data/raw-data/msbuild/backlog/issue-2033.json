  "title": "Wrong and weird build behavior after upgrading to VS 2017 ",
  "body": "I have a solution with many projects. Since I've upgraded to VS 2017 I've faced weird build behavior problems.\r\n\r\n1. I cleaned up the solution\r\n2. I **build** the solution, some of the dll assemblies were outdated! For example I build the solution today, but some assemblies modified-date were about a month ago. ( I'm 100% sure, source code of those assemblies were changed today ). I also used a dotnet reflector to decompile the assembly and I saw the code is outdated and that's not the code that I wrote today.\r\n3. I **rebuild** the project, the msbuild result were about a couple of compile errors\r\n3.1 Errors such as `CS1061\t'xxx' does not contain a definition for 'yyy' and no extension method 'Move' accepting a first argument of type 'xxx' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)`\r\n3.2 The most weird thing is those `xxx` and `yyy` are do exist! and if I rebuild that project alone , that error won't show up!\r\n\r\n**Some important notes:**\r\n\r\n1. I have a `PowerShell` script to build my solution. \r\n2. The resutl from `PowerShell` script and build inside VS is the same, and the same weird behavior.\r\n3. Everything were fine before VS 2017 and its msbuild.\r\n",
