        "body": "Purpose of this class was to redirect all console writes from msbuild server to its client (invoker).\r\nSince msbuild access console in serial fashion, this class was not originally written as thread safe. However, if custom code (tasks, logger and such) do call console flush directly it might interfere with logging service thread. Accessing console directly is not supported and customers shall avoid it. But if I understand it correctly, console is wired with `_syncWriter = Synchronized(this);` which is supposed to be thread safe wrapper.\r\nI recommend to close this issues as \"this is fine\".\r\n@MichalPavlik as an author of these particular lines, what is your take?",
