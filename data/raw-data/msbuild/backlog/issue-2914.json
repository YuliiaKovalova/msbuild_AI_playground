  "body": "Follow up to https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2803\r\n\r\nThe NuGet SDK resolver currently only supports using NuGet.config for restore settings. NuGet.config is not expressive enough to allow conditionally changing settings, and there are currently [no plans to change that](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3972). Instead, users are instructed to use `/target:Restore` and [MSBuild properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/msbuild-targets#restore-target) to conditionally configure restore settings. However, these properties are not available during the SDK resolution phase, so they cannot be used to control the restore used by the NuGet SDK resolver.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to provide ways to control restore settings in way that is consistent between the NuGet SDK resolver  and `/t:Restore`.",

There are scenarios like source-build where we build all the repo's that make up the .NET Core product and they need to use a version of an sdk that was built from source and so we need a way to tell all the repo's to use that version without necessary committing or overwriting changes in every repo.
