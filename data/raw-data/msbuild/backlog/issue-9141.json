  "title": "[Bug]: The Copy task should log absolute paths",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nSimilar to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/3506, but when hardlink is used.\r\n\r\nOriginally, #3506 was to fix https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/issues/180, and it seems like https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/issues/180 is still an issue when using hardlinks.\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nHave a build with the following properties set:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n\t\t<CreateHardLinksForCopyFilesToOutputDirectoryIfPossible>true</CreateHardLinksForCopyFilesToOutputDirectoryIfPossible>\r\n\r\n\t\t<CreateHardLinksForCopyLocalIfPossible>true</CreateHardLinksForCopyLocalIfPossible>\r\n\t\t<CreateHardLinksForAdditionalFilesIfPossible>true</CreateHardLinksForAdditionalFilesIfPossible>\r\n\t\t<CreateHardLinksForPublishFilesIfPossible>true</CreateHardLinksForPublishFilesIfPossible>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Copy task should log full absolute path.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Copy task logs relative paths. The writes to `Project1/bin/Release/File.dll` and `Project2/bin/Release/File.dll` will both be logged as `bin/Release/File.dll` and will be considered as double writes even though they are really different. So basically the same issue as https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/issues/180\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
