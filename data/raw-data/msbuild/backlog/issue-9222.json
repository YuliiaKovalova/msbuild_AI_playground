  "title": "[Bug]: MSBuild.exe does not build deps.json file",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI am currently working on a console application in .NET Core, and it previously had a reference to the \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll\" library. However, we recently removed this reference from our project.\r\n\r\nOur build process relies on automated builds using MSBuild.exe rather than Visual Studio. The problem I'm encountering is that when I build the solution from Visual Studio, I can observe that the deps.json file is updated correctly, and it removes the reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll.\" However, when I build the solution using MSBuild.exe, the deps.json file is not updated, and it still contains a reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll.\"\r\n\r\nI'm looking for guidance on how to resolve this issue or if there's a viable workaround available.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Download the provided source code for the sample console application. ([MSBuildIssueSourceCode.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/12645763/MSBuildIssue.zip))\r\n\r\n2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2019.\r\n\r\n3. Build the solution using Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n4. After building, you will notice that the deps.json file is created by Visual Studio, and it contains a reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll.\"\r\n\r\n5. Now, remove the \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll\" library reference from the solution, but do not make any changes to any of the C# files.\r\n\r\n6. Build the solution using MSBuild.exe with the following command:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   msbuild.exe H:\\Work\\Source\\POC\\MSBuildIssue\\MSBuildIssue.sln\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n7. After executing the MSBuild command, you will observe that the deps.json file is not updated, and it still contains a reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll.\"\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen building the solution using MSBuild.exe after removing the reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll\" from the project, the deps.json file should be updated to reflect the removal of the reference. This means that the reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll\" should no longer be present in the deps.json file after the build process is complete.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\ndeps.json file is not updated, and it still contains a reference to \"MyThirdPartyLibrary.dll.\"\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.11.2+f32259642 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
