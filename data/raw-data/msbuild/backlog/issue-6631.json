  "body": "Prior to MSBuild 16.10 we've been using command line to generate msixupload file \r\n\r\n```\r\nnuget.exe restore My_Solution.sln\r\n\r\nMSBuild.exe My_Solution.sln /t:My_Target_Desktop_Packaging /p:Configuration=\"Release\" /p:AppxBundlePlatforms=\"x86|x64\" /p:Platform=\"x86\" /p:Platform=\"x64\" /p:UapAppxPackageBuildMode=StoreUpload /p:AppxPackageDir=\"./../AppPackages\" /p:PackageCertificateKeyFile=\"distribution-cert.pfx\" /p:PackageCertificatePassword=*** /v:minimal /nr:false\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything was working good. After upgrading to MSBuild 16.10, msixupload file is still generated, but x64 version of application stopped working. If you launch the application, nothing happens. App exits with code -2147450750\r\n\r\nIf I swap x86,x64 to x64,x86. Then x64 works, but x86 does not\r\nIf I clean my solution (git clean -xdf) and publish only x64, it works\r\nIf I clean my solution (git clean -xdf) and publish only x86, it works\r\nIf I clean my solution (git clean -xdf) and publish x86, it works, then I publish x64 and it doesn't work\r\n\r\nSo it looks like something from previous platform build impacts next platform build and causes it to not work. After downgrading to MSBuild 16.9, everything works.",

Confirm that this still reproduces with 16.10.3 (we fixed a bug with solution `/t:Something` in 16.10 patches, and you may be seeing a symptom of that).\r\n2. If it still reproduces, [open a feedback ticket instead](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/feedback-options)?\r\n\r\nAfter it's created, that will open an internal bug which will be routed to the right team.
