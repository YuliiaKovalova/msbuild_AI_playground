This would be verbose, but could help catch really difficult issues where we have 0 errors, 0 warnings but the build failed.\r\n\r\nSee more inspiration and details here:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/KirillOsenkov/status/1469388468824330241\r\n\r\nand here:\r\nhttps://github.com/KirillOsenkov/Bliki/wiki/First-chance-exceptions",
