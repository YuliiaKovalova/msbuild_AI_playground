  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Create a Windows Server Core Docker image with VS Build Tools 15.7 (lower should have the same issue).\r\n- Start a container with a folder from the host mounted as a volume inside the container.\r\n- Put a VS solution with C++ projects inside the volume, it should have PDB format (not C7 compatible).\r\n- Build the solution.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nBuild succeeds\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nBuild fails with \"cannot open program database\".\r\nYou can now see that mspdbsrv still has a lock on PDB file(s).\r\nWhen the solution is copied to inside the container (so it's not in a mounted volume anymore) and then built the same way it works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /15.7` output:\r\n```\r\nc:\\externalvolume\\component-vshaper\\vshaperlib\\stdafx.cpp(9): error C2471: cann\r\not update program database 'C:\\externalvolume\\component-vshaper\\VShaperLib\\Debu\r\ng\\VShaperLib.idb' [C:\\externalvolume\\component-vshaper\\VShaperLib\\VShaperLib.vc\r\nxproj]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHandle output\r\n```\r\n../handle64.exe C:\\externalvolume\\component-vshaper\\VShaperLib\\Debug\\VShaperLib.idb\r\nNthandle v4.11 - Handle viewer\r\nCopyright (C) 1997-2017 Mark Russinovich\r\nSysinternals - www.sysinternals.com\r\n\r\nmspdbsrv.exe       pid: 1284   type: File           12C: C:\\externalvolume\\component-vshaper\\VShaperLib\\Debug\\VShaperLib.idb\r\n```\r\n",

        "body": "Just a remark for other people that like to have this working: I discovered that even if it would work it's not the ideal way to go. When running in Hyper-V isolation mode the disk IO to a mounted volume is a rather slow compared to IO to files inside the container itself. I suspect this is due to the isolation and there is probably no such performance hit when running native containers.\r\nBecause compilation usually creates a lot of random IO to lots of small source files your compilation time will be longer.",

I ge the error C2471 about vc140.idb, but on the host I get that the file is locked by \"vmwp.exe\". I am using HyperV isolation.\r\nSo it seems to be a problem with the way the compiler is writing to its idb file, because I can create, update and delete regular files just fine. There is a bug here, not just related directly to msbuild.",
