  "body": "When using `dotnet build`, attempting to sign assemblies results in\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4062: The \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.SignFile\" task could not be loaded from the assembly Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.\r\nConfirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is declared in Microsoft.Common.tasks:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <UsingTask TaskName=\"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.SignFile\"                              AssemblyName=\"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\" Condition=\"'$(MSBuildAssemblyVersion)' != ''\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the task is only present in the .NET Framework version of the assembly, not in the standard/core version.\r\n\r\nOddly, the backend signing methods ARE present in the core assembly (`SecurityUtilities.SignFile()`), so there does not seem to be any reason to omit the task.\r\n\r\nThe task should be added to the standard/core assembly too; on non-Windows it can fail with PNSE, but on Windows it should work with `dotnet build` the same way it does with `msbuild`.\r\n\r\nIf that is not possible, it should still be added so that it can give a useful error rather than MSB4062, because that suggests user/configuration error.\r\n",
