  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe are building a socket server as a .NET console app.  It just uses basic .net core stuff, but is being developed on a Windows machine using Visual Studio.  The project is in a MyServer.sln file.\r\n\r\nOn macOS, when I try to build I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash> dotnet msbuild MyServer.sln /ds\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.1.545.13942\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/1.0.0-rc4-004771/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1111,5): \r\nerror MSB3644: The reference assemblies for framework \".NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1\" were not \r\nfound. To resolve this, install the SDK or Targeting Pack for this framework version or retarget your \r\napplication to a version of the framework for which you have the SDK or Targeting Pack installed. \r\nNote that assemblies will be resolved from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and will be used in \r\nplace of reference assemblies. Therefore your assembly may not be correctly targeted for the \r\nframework you intend. \r\n[/Users/joel/src/MyPlatform/PresenceLabs/Platform/PresenceLabs.Platform.csproj]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean and how can we fix this?\r\n\r\nTo repeat, MyServer.sln builds and runs just fine on the same macOS.  It's just that we can't build with msbuild.\r\n\r\nThis should work!  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
