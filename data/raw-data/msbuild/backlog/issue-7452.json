  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nBuilding a WinUI app under .NET 6 results in the following error\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4062: The \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.GetInstalledSDKLocations\" task could not be loaded from the assembly Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.  Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIts difficult to reproduce because `dotnet build` support for WinUI is currently in progress. However the attached binlog should contain the required data.\r\n\r\n[msbuild.binlog.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/8214855/msbuild.binlog.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`GetInstalledSDKLocations` should be available under .NET 6\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe following build error \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4062: The \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.GetInstalledSDKLocations\" task could not be loaded from the assembly Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.  Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nIt looks like this Task was removed from the `Core` build of `Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\ndotnet --version\r\n6.0.201",
