  "body": "Hi,\r\nI've tried to read properties of a C++ Project to evaluate the sdk paths that are used in this project. The first issue I encountered was that the environment variable VCTargetsPath wasn't set so the .cpp.props and .cpp.targets files couldn't be resolved which resulted in an exception. I fixed this by setting the environment variable temporarily by code but doesn't seem to me like clean code so I search for a better way to do this but didn't find one so is there a better way to solve this?",
