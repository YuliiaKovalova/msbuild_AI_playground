        "body": "Thank you @JhonnyPala for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\nCan you please share more information to help us pinpoint the issue?:\r\n\r\n1. In what scenario (VS build, `dotnet build`, `msbuild.exe`) is this happening and what version are you on (`dotnet --version`, `msbuild.exe -version`)?\r\n2. Is there any specific steps/setup leading to a crash? - I'm trying to see if there is a chance for minimal repro (I understand this can be problematic)\r\n3. Would you be able to collect a dump of the crash (you can e.g. use [ProcDump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump): `procdump -ma -e -x . <your command line + -bl>` to monitor the app for crash and collect dump into current folder). Adding a `-bl` argument to the `dotnet build` or `msbuild.exe` command will generate a [binlog](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/3777dcaf7edb3e86a070037ba53e742dd1872873/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md) that can as well greatly help during investigation",
