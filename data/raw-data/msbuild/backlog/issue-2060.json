  "body": "The suggestion is to include part of the git commit hash into the output of the command-line tool: `Microsoft (R) Build Engine version <version> (<hash>)`\r\n\r\nThis is a feature we added to Roslyn (`csc.exe` and `vbc.exe`) [recently](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/17537). It is pretty handy for us. I think it may be useful on `msbuild.exe` as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>msbuild\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.3.124.61808\r\n\r\n>csc\r\nMicrosoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 2.3.0.61703 (a255d491)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI @rainersigwald ",
