        "body": "This one's interesting in xplat. Right now it's only working because of a confluence of bugs.\n\nWhen I merged the adoption of GitVersioning in, I accidentally broke the restore-build-time-packages code, so that it never runs (because it's [still looking for the old packages.config](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/2001dcb8afab050d017acdf411bcc82e0a952c82/src/.nuget/packageLoad.targets#L41)).\n\nThat keeps the target file from ever existing and made the fix from 5fd4249 equivalent to just disabling it--which is fine for now, since this issue is to track making sure it works everywhere.\n\nThe reason this didn't break in CI is because xplat only builds for netcore in CI, and the \"standard\" build uses an old netcore MSBuild to bootstrap, so the old condition always evaluates to \"don't bother with GitVersioning\".\n",
