It certainly _seems_ to have been set correctly (and a diag log indicates that too), but it's not available in the other target.\n\nThis was pointed out by @rohit21agrawal over IM.\n",

Count was never greater than zero even though the items were defined in the previous target. \r\n\r\nPlease fix for both properties & item / groups. Also, while we are at it... *please* let me pass actual parameters into targets instead of having to define global property groups to pass parameters into targets",
