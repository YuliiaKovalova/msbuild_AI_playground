  "title": "Support \"quiet\" verbosity in terminal logger",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nRespect \"quiet\" verbosity in the terminal logger by minimizing or eliminating _persistent_ output lines (while preserving the \"live\" status display that is the point of TL).\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nToday, `-tl` disregards verbosity settings (for example `-v:q`), because there are many existing \"high\" priority build messages that don't seem, in retrospect, to be very high-priority. However, that means that there's also no way to _reduce_ output from the terminal logger.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nWhen verbosity is set to quiet, do not emit messages like \"restore finished\", the \"primary output of the project\" message, or \"build finished\".\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
