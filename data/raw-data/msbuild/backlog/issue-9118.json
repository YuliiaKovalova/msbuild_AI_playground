  "title": "[Bug]: MSBuild don't recognize '/' in folder name in macOS and Linux",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI created an ASP.NET Core application on macOS with the folder name \"ECharge/Backend\". While macOS and Linux support the use of slashes (\"/\") in folder names, MSBuild does not recognize them. This leads to an error where it cannot find the bin or obj folders within the \"ECharge/Backend\" directory. However, when I remove the slash and rename the directory to \"EChargeBackend\", everything works as expected.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n### Environment Setup:\r\nOperating System: macOS Ventura 13.5\r\n.NET SDK Version: 7.0.306\r\nMSBuild Version: MSBuild version 17.6.8+c70978d4d for .NET 17.6.8.32104% \r\n\r\n### Project Creation:\r\nCLI to create a new ASP.NET Core application with the following command: `dotnet new webapp -o ECharge/Backend`\r\n\r\n### Build the Project:\r\nNavigate to the project directory: `cd ECharge/Backend` and `dotnet build`\r\n\r\n### Observe the Issue:\r\nAt this point, MSBuild throws an error, indicating that it cannot find the bin or obj folders within the \"ECharge/Backend\" directory.\r\nThe specific error message is: (ProjectName.csproj.*.props not found)\r\nWorkaround Observation:\r\nRename the directory to \"EChargeBackend\" (removing the slash) and run dotnet build again.\r\nThe build process completes successfully, indicating that the slash in the folder name is the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMSBuild should be able to recognize and handle directory names containing slashes (\"/\") on macOS and Linux systems, given that they're valid characters in these systems for folder names.\r\nThe build process should succeed without errors and recognize the bin and obj folders within such directories.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen creating an ASP.NET Core application in a folder named \"ECharge/Backend\" on macOS, MSBuild fails to recognize the directory properly.\r\nAn error is thrown indicating that MSBuild cannot find the bin or obj folders within the \"ECharge/Backend\" directory.\r\nRenaming the directory to \"EChargeBackend\" (removing the slash) resolves the issue, indicating that the slash in the folder name is the cause of the problem.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
