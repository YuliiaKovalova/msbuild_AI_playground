  "title": "[Bug]: CA1825 FP with .NET Framework MSBuild only",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nUsing MSBuild for .NET Framework on a project with .NET 6.0 SDK via global.json and enabled NET Analyzers, I get false positives for CA1825 on attributes with `params` parameters.\r\nThe FPs [are documented](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1825#when-to-suppress-warnings).\r\n\r\nMy issue is the inconsistency between MSBuild for .NET and MSBuild for .NET Framework in the very same version.\r\n\r\nThe FPs do not occur with dotnet CLI, but only with MSBuild for .NET Framework.\r\nThis is something I expect to get fixed on a .NET SDK corresponding to an LTS version.\r\n\r\nA new Visual Studio update would also be necessary to distribute the fixed MSBuild for .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nSwitching to .NET 7.0 SDK fixes the FPs in both CLI and VS as expected.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate xunit test project with some \u00b4MemberData` annotation.\r\nSet SDK 6.0 via global.json\r\nEnable NET Analyzers on the project.\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nConsistent behavior in Visual Studio, i. e. MSBuild for .NET Framework and dotnet CLI, i. e. MSBuild for .NET.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFP for CA1825 with VS, but not with dotnet CLI.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild 17.5.1+f6fdcf537 for .NET Framework\r\nMSBuild 17.5.1+f6fdcf537 for .NET",
