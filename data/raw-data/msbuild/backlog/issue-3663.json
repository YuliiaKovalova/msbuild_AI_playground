That's a somewhat misleading error, because it refers to a `csc.exe` command-line parameter, which you should normally not specify because you can use MSBuild properties to specify the language version. To see what's currently supported, find the path to `csc.exe` that was invoked (it should be in your build log; if it's not you might try capturing higher verbosity logs). `csc.exe` may also be in your environment's `PATH`.\r\n\r\nOn my machine, in a Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017, I get\r\n\r\n```\r\ns:\\msbuild>csc.exe /langversion:?\r\nSupported language versions:\r\ndefault\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7.0 (default)\r\n7.1\r\n7.2\r\n7.3 (latest)\r\nlatest\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @jaredpar for feedback on confusion around the langversion error message when triggered through MSBuild.",
