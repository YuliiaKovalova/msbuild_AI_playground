        "body": "Definitely agree about this one. \n\nCurrently, I think the \"biggest\" hindrances to getting this done are:\n- [The xplat build-script](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/build.pl) is perl-based, as opposed to being a regular shell-script used everywhere else in the world of dotnet.\n- The xplat-branch seems to be a long-living feature-branch.\n\nFirst point means we need to write and maintain dedicated code for this project and this project only, instead of just copying something proven which works everywhere from another dotnet-project. That's probably not a show-stopper though.\n\nWhat might make it so is that the xplat-branch has an uncertain future. xplat and master is diverging and needs to get merged to ensure the long-term viability of code submitted to the xplat-branch.\n\nI mean, who wants to submit patches only to have them end up in a dead, unmaintained branch?\n",

Ahead of all dotnet projects I must say (dotnet/home#29). :smile: \n",
