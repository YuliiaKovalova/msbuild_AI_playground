It's the small inconsistencies like this that can lead to frustration. If you're not going to follow dotnet core's usage syntax, then don't include it as a dotnet core command. If you must include it as a dotnet core command, then add dotnet core's equivalent switches.\r\n\r\n",

I've got a question about the scope of this issue:\r\n\r\nIn your comment, you've said:\r\n\r\n> It should be possible to additionally support `--` options.\r\n\r\nBut in the issue's description I can also see the second case:\r\n> dotnet msbuild -help ' also displays usage help (INCONSISTENT)\r\n\r\nwhich is separating long version (considered when \"--\") from short version (considered when \"-\" or \"/\"). \r\nFor consistency it should also be covered, but on the other hand it would mess with backward compatibility (`-help` would no longer be available, as `dotnet -help` shows an error).\r\n\r\nCan you share your thoughts on this? Perhaps Team Triage has already discussed it.",

As it stands, `/h` and `/help` are consistent with both `dotnet build` and `dotnet msbuild`, they all display help messages.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that we'll decide to match functionality with `dotnet` with the caveat that we don't regress any existing inconsistencies. This would enable both `dotnet msbuild -help` and `dotnet msbuild --help`. At least that way we're ... consistently inconsistent \ud83d\udc40\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss this in our bug triage meeting Wednesday morning and get back to you then!\r\n",
