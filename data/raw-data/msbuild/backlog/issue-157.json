  "body": "When I try to build V8 for ArangoDB, two solution files are generated by gyp(?). If I try to build the projects/targets `v8`, `v8_libbase` or `v8_libplatform` by build script or manually, `msbuild` will fail because it can't find the targets:\n\n```\n> msbuild all.sln /t:v8\nerror MSB4057: the target package \"v8\" does not exist in the project\n```\n\nThe projects clearly do exist, but they are (for whatever reason) nested in solution folders like this:\n\n```\n(tools)\n    |_ (gyp)\n           |_ v8\n```\n\n![project_file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1309249/9360010/223e603c-4694-11e5-83a7-1634f6dac646.png)\n\nNote the brackets `()` in the folder names. If I remove them, `msbuild all.sln /t=tools\\gyp\\v8` will work!\n\nSo nesting is generally supported, but parentheses cause trouble. I couldn't find a way to escape them, and I don't know how to change the sln generator to not nest projects. If I remove the solution folders entirely, `msbuild all.sln /t:v8` will also work.\n\nSolution file: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39101475/BugReports/all.sln\n\nMaybe somewhere around here escaping or I don't know what needs to be done:\n\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/XMakeBuildEngine/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/TargetBuilder.cs#L171\n",
