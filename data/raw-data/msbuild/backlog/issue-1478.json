By convention, MSBuild looks for these reference assemblies installed via Mono, or if the environment variable 'ReferenceAssemblyRoot' has been set to their location. \r\n\r\nIf we could set 'ReferenceAssemblyRoot' as an MSBuild property, this would enable scenarios such as https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/3934, which would allow us to distribute the .NET Framework reference assemblies as a NuGet package.",

We essentially ship the framework reference assemblies in a NuGet package and then set our `TargetFrameworkRootPath` to point into that NuGet.
