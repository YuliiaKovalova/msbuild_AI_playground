  "body": "In msbuild, one can call targets which do not exist by setting SkipNonexistentTargets on the MSBuild task.\r\nThe static graph target protocol does not support this and will call the nonexistent targets which results in a build failure.\r\n\r\nA possible implementation would be to support  `<ProjectReferenceTargets Include='Build' Targets='GetTargetFrameworks' SkipNonexistentTargets='true'>` which would instruct the target propagation code to take out non existing targets.",
