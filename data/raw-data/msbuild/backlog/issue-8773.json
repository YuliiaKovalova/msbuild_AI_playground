  "title": "[Feature Request]: Enable Terminal Logger integration with other terminal-aware tools",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nProvide a mechanism for a build to opt-in external executable invocations (ie. the `Exec` task or on `ToolTask`) to have their output included in the TerminalLogger output.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nThe new Terminal Logger introduced in .NET 8.0.100 Preview 4 is really slick and I really enjoy it. I have noticed one limitation though. When invoking scripts through `Exec`, all output is swallowed. In some cases, the `Exec` task is executing another tool that is also \"terminal-aware\" and whose output would fit in with the new logger. Also, if the external tool doesn't output errors with a recognized warning/error format, then the build would fail, but the error would not be visible.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm hitting this scenario with dotnet/runtime's usage of the Ninja build system for our native build. Ninja is also terminal-aware, but the mechanism of invoking the script with the `ninja` command through MSBuild ends up blocking the terminal-aware experience. Additionally, when using the new TerminalLogger, the output from the `ninja` command is hidden.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nProvide a mechanism (such as a property on `ToolTask`) to signal MSBuild to execute the underlying command such that tools executed by that command recognize their stdout as a smart terminal and that the output is shown to the user.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "Yep! This one is going to take A LOT of design, even more than the proposed issue for signalling progress reporting from tasks. I'm not sure that we should go down a road that makes MSBuild start acting like a virtual TTY to that degree, but am happy to talk more about the use case. There will likely be a number of enhancements to TerminalLogger based on issues and feedback like this, so we're in a 'wait and see' mode for the near future while we gather feedback.",

        "body": "Another, much cheaper, idea would be to allow developers to configure (with regex) how to represent an Exec task's output with the logger. There could be options with a user-provided pattern/regex for \"show this line as part of this target's output\" so users could emulate the secondary tool's terminal integration. This would help solve our problem.",
