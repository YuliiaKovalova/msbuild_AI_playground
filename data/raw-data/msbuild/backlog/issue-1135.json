  "body": "Node reuse is only supported on Desktop. Currently, we'll complain if you try to (redundantly) disable it with an error like\n\n```\nMSBUILD : error MSB1001: Unknown switch. Switch: /nr:false\n```\n\nBut that requires a lot of hoop-jumping to make sure scripts disable it only in exactly the right places. MSBuild could just accept and ignore the switch to make script authoring easier (for example in dotnet/SDK#196).\n",
