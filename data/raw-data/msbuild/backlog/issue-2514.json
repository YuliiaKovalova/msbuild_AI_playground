  "title": "Guidance -> building a nuget packaged msbuild task that runs everywhere.",
  "body": "I am trying to create an msbuild task that is packaged up as a nuget package, and runs when the project is build via dotnet build or desktop msbuild. \r\n\r\nI think I have come close, but no cigar.\r\n\r\nIn my tasks csproj I am multitargeting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <TargetFrameworks>net461;netcoreapp2.0</TargetFrameworks>   \r\n```\r\n\r\nAgainst these msbuild packages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n <ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)'=='net461'\">\r\n     <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Build.Framework\" Version=\"14.3.0\">\r\n      <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>\r\n    </PackageReference>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core\" Version=\"14.3.0\">\r\n      <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>\r\n    </PackageReference>\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)'=='netcoreapp2.0'\">   \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core\" Version=\"15.5.0-preview-000074-0946838\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Build.Framework\" Version=\"15.5.0-preview-000074-0946838\" />\r\n      </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a tests project, that runs under `netcoreapp2.0` and uses the same version of msbuild (15.5.0-preview-000074-0946838) to build a test project file, that is referencing my custom task assembly but from its build output folder (bin/debug/netcoreapp2.0) rather than its location within a nuget package.. When I do this, everything works (test passes).\r\n\r\nWhen I `dotnet pack` my msbuild task, I noticed that the nuget package did not contain all of the assemblies for its dependencies (as typically they would be resolved as nuget dependencies to other nuget packages) - so to fix this I added this to my csproj:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis then gave me a nuget package that has zero nuget dependencies listed in the nuspec, but has a build folder with my targets file in, and two folders under the tools\\ folder, one containing my msbuild task compiled for net461 (which works) and the other containing my msbuild task compiled for netcoreapp2.0 (which I am having the issues with) - and each folder also containing all of the assemblies that are output with the build.\r\n\r\nMy problem now, is that when I create a new project, and add my nuget package as a package reference, and I then run a `dotnet build` on that project file - my msbuild task fails to load with a message along the lines of:\r\n\r\n \"cannot convert ITask[] to ITask[]\" (Not exact message but hopefully you get the gist). \r\n\r\nI can't find any further information anywhere. My best guess is that it is trying to cast ITask from one version of the msbuild assembly, to the same type in another version of the msbuild assembly - could that be the case? If so - it would be very helpful to know the version I should be referencing for compatibility purposes with netcoreapp2.0.\r\n\r\nThe amount of hurdles to overcome to get this working has been quite time consuming so far - do you have some guidance around how to realise the promise of `NETStandard` by writing some msbuild task once that runs everywhere and is distributed like all other modern day .NET day dependencies - via nuget? \r\n\r\nI have looked at [NerdBank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/blob/master/src/MSBuildExtensionTask/MSBuildExtensionTask.csproj) which has been a great help so far, but as it is targeting netcoreapp1 and I am trying to target netcoreapp2.0.\r\n\r\nLastly, in case you are wondering why I needed to use msbuild nuget packages 15.5 preview versions, it was because of an issue where when trying to build an sdk style project, msbuild libraries were complaining that they could not locate various sdk related targets files. It was necessary to set various environment variables and global properties to try and work around this (and I wasn't very successful) - something that was later fixed in 15.5. version of the packages.\r\n\r\n",
