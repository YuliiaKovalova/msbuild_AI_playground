  "title": "Win 10 Anniversary Update Caused MSBuild Break with StyleCop UsingTask",
  "body": "After my machine updated to the Win 10 anniversary update, I've been getting this MSBuild/StyleCop Error across all the projects in my solution.  I even nuked and re-pulled my TFS enlistment down and uninstalled/reinstalled StyleCop, but nothing worked:\n\n`Error  1   The \"StyleCopTask\" task could not be loaded from the assembly C:\\code\\myproject\\Build\\StyleCop\\4.7\\\\StyleCop.dll. Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Build.Utilities.v3.5, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.`\n\nIt looks like the offending line is in the MSBuild StyleCop.targets file:\n\n`<UsingTask AssemblyFile=\"$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\..\\StyleCop 4.7\\StyleCop.dll\" TaskName=\"StyleCopTask\"/>`\n\nIt looks like something is mangling the path, if I follow what I expect to be the target, I see the StyleCop.dll file.  I received the update on my other machine and it's still working fine (and has the exact same targets file and structure).  Nothing else has changed.  \n\nHow can I resolve this issue?\n",
