  "title": "Where should signtool.exe be installed for MSBuild 15.0 to find it?",
  "body": "Our build on VSTS was failing because it couldn't find signtool.exe to sign a ClickOnce project. We have (in addition to the VS 2017 build tools) the *Individual components -> Code tools -> ClickOnce Publishing* component installed, so signtool.exe is in the `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\ClickOnce\\SignTool` directory. But it seems that this directory is not searched by MSBuild.\r\n\r\nI worked around the issue with a PowerShell build step to copy signtool.exe to the project's directory, since that is the last location to be searched:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$source = \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\ClickOnce\\SignTool\\signtool.exe\"\r\n$target = \"MyProject\\signtool.exe\"\r\n\r\nWrite-Host \"Copy signtool.exe to project directory\"\r\nWrite-Host \"Current directory: $((Get-Item -Path \".\\\" -Verbose).FullName)\"\r\nWrite-Host \"Source: $($source)\"\r\nWrite-Host \"Target: $($target)\"\r\n\r\nCopy-Item $source $target\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm guessing MSBuild tries to find signtool.exe in one of the `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows` directories, but this is all internal stuff (see #425) unknown to us consumers. It shouldn't be this hard to get a build working for a ClickOnce project.",

I managed to run a separate standalone installation of this component directly on an MSBuild installation using a few tricks, and my builds seem to run. But still this is a workaround, exactly like yours is. Actually - that workaround of yours is simpler and I have changed my build pipeline to run a signtool.exe in the project folder. Thanks for the tip.",
