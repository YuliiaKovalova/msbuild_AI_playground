  "body": "**Version Used**: \r\nMSBuild version 17.3.1+2badb37d1 for .NET Framework\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2022 (64-bit) Version 17.3.6\r\ndotnet 6.0\r\n\r\n`dotnet build --version` reports MSBuild version 17.3.2+561848881 for .NET.\r\n\r\nThis issue only shows up when building from Visual Studio, or when using MSBuild. `dotnet build` does not exhibit this issue.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Create a project with a long path; mine was 216 character starting with C:\\ and ending in csproj.\r\n2. msbuild project or build it in VS\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nCompiles fine.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nError: Could not find a part of the path GeneratedMSBuildEditorConfig.editorconfig Microsoft.Managed.Core.target\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nRename the csproj file and possibly other folders in the path to reduce the path length to less than 222 chars.\r\n\r\n_This is because the additional characters added by \\obj\\Debug\\...GeneratedMSBuildEditorConfig.editorconfig takes the total path length over 256 characters, which is a path limit for certain parts of Windows._",
