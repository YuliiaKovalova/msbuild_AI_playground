  "body": "In current model, the MSBuild Task executes and waits for all child project to complete before resuming.  This is great for considering when waiting for Outputs.  However, to maximize Parallelism, references sometimes logic doesn't need the output right away.  In this regard, add an option to start building the child projects and resuming running current project.\r\n\r\nWhen the current project needs the output of the child project, it may invoke a blocking call for the result.\r\n\r\nTask Outputs may not be available and should probably warn if queuing for it.\r\n\r\nThanks",
