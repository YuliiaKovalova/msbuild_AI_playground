That would help determine if there's an evaluation-time bottleneck (I've seen expensive property functions and long-running recursive glob expansions), and if it had the same `N calls` tracking it would also help determine that a project was built under multiple sets of global properties. I noticed this while investigating #1276 which is about VS operations taking a long time, primarily because evaluation time doubled since references got evaluated twice.",
