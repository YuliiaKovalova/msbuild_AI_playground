        "body": "At a theoretical level, that seems very broken to me since we'll be shipping in .NET 8 for several more releases.\r\n\r\nPractically, we're pretty entangled with the .NET SDK we use to build ourselves because of how we do our bootstrap construction, so moving ahead to .NET 9 alphas makes it harder to test our repo. We could probably fix this but I've spent time on it before and it's fairly complicated.",
