  "body": "`GenerateBindingRedirects` is always executed due to `SuggestedBindingRedirects` not being a file.\r\nThis doesn't work well with `GeneratePackageOnBuild` since this target is called again during `Pack` and changing `.config` file timestamp.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nProject file\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFrameworks>\r\n    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Build.Locator\" Version=\"1.2.6\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun build in VS multiple times.\r\nUpToDate check fails with:\r\n```\r\n1>FastUpToDate: Checking copied output (UpToDateCheckBuilt with Original property) file 'C:\\Users\\xen\\source\\repos\\ConsoleAppFUTD\\ConsoleAppFUTD\\obj\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\ConsoleAppFUTD.dll.config': (ConsoleAppFUTD)\r\n1>FastUpToDate:     Source 2020-06-05 11:49:36: 'C:\\Users\\xen\\source\\repos\\ConsoleAppFUTD\\ConsoleAppFUTD\\obj\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\ConsoleAppFUTD.dll.config'.

This results in wrong timestamps for next build/fast-up-to-date check.\r\n\r\nIt can't even be skipped because the `GenerateBindingRedirects` target contains `SuggestedBindingRedirects` in its list of `Target.Inputs`, and those items are assemblynames instead of files. As a result, the target Inputs/Outputs check will **always** fail.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/dc485bce3427e9d2b020ce61c2400e7b5a76062c/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L2194\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFastUpToDate check work and build is skipped\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nFastUpToDate check doesn't work\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows 10\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\nVisual Studio 16.6.0",

Let's see if we can figure out why that was (to make sure it wasn't  a good idea for some reason) and then fix it.",
