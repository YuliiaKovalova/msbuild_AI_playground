  "body": "When MSBuild is run with `-restore` there are two distinct build phases:\r\n\r\n1. Run the `Restore` target\r\n2. Run the default target (or target specified on the command line)\r\n\r\nEither can create many project build requests, and have progress.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if the logger knew when restore was happening and didn't give a misleading progress indicator (\"90% of projects 'built' for restore\" is very distinct from \"the overall build is 90% complete\").",
