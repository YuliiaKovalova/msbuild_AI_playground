  "body": "I ran into this using the locally built bootstrapped version of MSBuild from the master branch.  So it's possible it's a bug in the bootstrapped version of MSBuild, but not in the real product.  Here's what happens:\r\n\r\nRun `msbuild restore <relative\\path\\to\\project.csproj`.  In my example:\r\n\r\n    C:\\git\\msbuild>artifacts\\Debug\\bootstrap\\net472\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe /restore ..\\..\\Users\\daplaist\\source\\repos\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1.csproj\r\n\r\n**Expected:** project builds successfully\r\n\r\n**Actual:** Restore succeeds, but when it tries to build the project, it fails, looking for a project with some of the elements duplicated.  In my case:\r\n\r\n> C:\\Users\\daplaist\\source\\repos\\Users\\daplaist\\source\\repos\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1.csproj : error MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded. Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\daplaist\\source\\repos\\Users\\daplaist\\source\\repos\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1\\ConsoleApp1.csproj'.\r\n\r\n@rainersigwald @cdmihai @livarcocc ",
