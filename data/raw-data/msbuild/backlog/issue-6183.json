Current process:\r\n1. Create IBuildEngineX\r\n2. Add one property\r\n3. Modify TaskHost and OOPTaskHost to implement the interface.\r\n\r\n### Potential Path Forward\r\n1. Create an IBuildEngineX that contains a `Dictionary<string, object>` where object is serializable.\r\n2. Mihai suggested an IBE with an abstract class called `EngineServices`.\r\n",
