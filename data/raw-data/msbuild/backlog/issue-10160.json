  "title": "[Feature Request]: Expand $(~) to $(HOME) or $(USERPROFILE) depending on OS",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nCurrently, you need to do something like the following to consistently get the `~` home directory in a cross-platform way:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <UserProfileHome Condition=\"'$([MSBuild]::IsOSUnixLike())' == 'true'\">$(HOME)</UserProfileHome>\r\n    <UserProfileHome Condition=\"'$([MSBuild]::IsOSUnixLike())' != 'true'\">$(USERPROFILE)</UserProfileHome>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if the well-known shorthand `~` (even PowerShell Core knows it) could be used directly in MSBuild as a built-in envvar alias for either `$(HOME)` or  `$(USERPROFILE)` depending on the current OS, just like `pwsh` does it.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nNo particular problem, just a desire for more consistency across developer tooling in the ecosystem (following the lead from `pwsh`).\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nSummary contains the proposal, which would be to consider `~` as an alias to either `Home` or `UserProfile` envvar names in Unix-like vs Windows.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
