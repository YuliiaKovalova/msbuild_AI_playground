Cannot find reference or redist files without a targeted architecture.\r\n\r\nThe redist list file \"{0}\" has a null or empty Redist name in the FileList element.

Can you check these?\r\n\r\n> Is \"redist\" the name of the folder (unlocalizable)? Thanks.\r\n\r\nIt is the name of a folder (the folder is actually `RedistList`) but I think that name is an internal implementation detail so it could be localizable.\r\n\r\n> Can we translate \"redist files\" as \"files of a redistributable package\"?\r\n\r\nI think so.\r\n\r\n> Is a \"redist list\" a list of redistributable packages?\r\n\r\nIt is a list of files within a single redist package.\r\n\r\n> Why is \"Redist\" capitalized in \"Redist name\"? Is it localizable (like \"name of the redistributable package\")?\r\n\r\nI think this is because it's referring to an XML attribute name that is capitalized, as in\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<FileList Redist=\"Microsoft-Windows-CLRCoreComp-v3.5\">\r\n```",
