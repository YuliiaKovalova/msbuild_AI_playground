  "body": "### Summary\n\nThere should be an analyzer that validates that Targets that explicitly track Inputs are accounting for Properties/Items that \r\nIn https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16325 we discovered that the `CoreCompile` Target wasn't tracking an value that was used by a Task inside the Target.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16325 is an example of this - the `$(SourceLink)` property points to the generated sourcelink file, and is an input to the `Csc` Task inside `CoreCompile`, but that Property isn't captured in the `Inputs` of `CoreCompile`.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nWe should have an analyzer that validates this and suggests that users add specific values to the Inputs list.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
