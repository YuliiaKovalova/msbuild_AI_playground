        "body": "Hey, @YuliiaKovalova , @ladipro , based on the net core document https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting, the code should call get_hostfxr_path in nethost library to get the path of hostfxr dll, and then understand where to load hostfxr.  It looks like the current msbuildLocator has never use nethost, so it really depends on some earlier code path loads it into the memory to work. It might be not the case under certain conditions, and basically, the current implementation has always had a gap here.\r\n\r\nand nethost.dll is in any of the NET Core runtime folder, so I assume it is in the searching path and I assume it can be loaded/bound correctly, so if we change the code to do that to resolve where to load hostfxr, it sounds to me the problem can be fixed.\r\n\r\n@YuliiaKovalova :, can we get this quickly resolved to address various SDK resolving issue on Mac platform?",
