  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nAfter running `./build.sh /p:CreateBootstrap=true` or `build.cmd /p:CreateBootstrap=true` I expected to see a `artifacts\\bin\\bootstrap\\net9.0\\MSBuild\\MSBuild.dll` file. The `artifacts\\bin\\bootstrap\\net9.0` is not created.\r\n\r\nHas the bootstrap been changed? A `core` folder with a `dotnet` executable is created. Is this an expected change in behavior?\r\n\r\nIn [Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild.md](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild.md) there is a sentence:\r\n\r\n> Now, just point dotnet ./artifacts/bin/bootstrap/<TARGET_FRAMEWORK>/MSBuild/MSBuild.dll at a project file. (Change <TARGET_FRAMEWORK> to current target framework, for example net7.0, net8.0)\r\n\r\nIs this document out of date? Is it now `./artifacts/bin/bootstrap/core/dotnet <project_file>`?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Run `./build.sh /p:CreateBootstrap=true` (*nix) or `build.cmd /p:CreateBootstrap=true` (Windows)\r\n2. Check the contents of ``artifacts/bin/bootstrap/`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn the past a framework folder would be created within `bootstrap`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nA `core` folder with a `dotnet` executable is created. Is this an expected change in behavior?\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "I think bootstrap was primarily targeted to produce a rehostable version of the desktop MSBuild, and it seems to be working fine for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAssuming you cloned MSBuild at C:\\MSBuild the binary would be at \r\nC:\\msbuild\\artifacts\\bin\\bootstrap\\net472\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\MSBuild.exe\r\n\r\nand the root directory would be at\r\nC:\\msbuild\\artifacts\\bin\\bootstrap\\net472\r\n\r\nYou can just zip or copy that directory and it should be self-contained. The Core MSBuild is somewhat limited (e.g. it won't build WPF projects for example).",

Maybe these are dead files.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the new behavior is an improvement and I'm updating my workflow.\r\nThanks",
