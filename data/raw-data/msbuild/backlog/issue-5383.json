  "body": "https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/5cb677292e0fe6f9db973d416ea866332833c306/src/Build/Logging/BinaryLogger/BinaryLogger.cs#L187\r\n\r\nThe docs say that the default for /bl is ProjectImports=Embed. However msbuild creates a zipfile, writes to it, then reads from to embed it in the binlog and deletes the zip file.\r\nThis is causing file lock contention with some tools we have (Metro bundler, used in React Native). The bundler watches for new files and .zip is one of the file extensions it watches. The end result is that metro tries accessing the newly created file while msbuild is writing it.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/issues/5388",

This currently breaks Release builds of some React Native for Windows apps.\r\nDuring the build we will call out to a tool that packs most files in the app's directory (js files, images, and unfortunately zip files too).\r\nBecause msbuild is holding this file open, the packing fails which breaks the build.\r\n\r\nThis shows up as an error like\r\n```\r\nEBUSY: resource busy or locked, open msbuild.ProjectImports.zip\r\n```\r\n",
