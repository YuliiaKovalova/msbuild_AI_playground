  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI have an issue with `msbuild` on my Azure DevOps hosted macOS agents.\r\n\r\nAs described in [this Azure DevOps announcement](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/6746), the way to select the xcode version should be done by performing:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo xcode-select -s \"/Applications/Xcode_14.0.1.app\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my pipeline there is an old Xamarin.Mac app that needs to be built with Xcode `14.0.1`, otherwise the build will fail.\r\nThe `_CoreCompileInterfaceDefinitions` of the `msbuild` output an `ibtool` call with arguments pointing to:\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n--sdk /Applications/Xcode_14.2.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX13.1.sdk\r\n```\r\n\r\nI *can* validate that the Xcode default version is set properly by running the code below after `xcode-select`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nxcode-select -print-path\r\nxcodebuild -version\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also tried pointing the Xcode.app symlink to my desired Xcode version but this did not fix the issue.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/Xcode.app\r\nln -svf /Applications/Xcode_14.0.1.app /Applications/Xcode.app \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create sample Xamarin.Mac application\r\n\r\n- Create and run build for hosted `macOS-12` agent on Azure DevOps:\r\n  - Set xcode version `sudo xcode-select -s \"/Applications/Xcode_14.0.1.app\"`\r\n  - Call `msbuild` to build sample Xamarin.Mac\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n- Build succeeds\r\n\r\n- Build logs show `_CoreCompileInterfaceDefinitions` uses selected Xcode version to build\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n- Build fails\r\n\r\n- Build logs show `_CoreCompileInterfaceDefinitions` uses `macOS-12` agent default Xcode version `14.2` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\nHow can I force `msbuild` to use a specific Xcode version for building my Xamarin.Mac app?\r\n\r\nOn my local Mac I don't have this issue (`msbuild` honors the selected Xcode version)\r\n",

Check `xcode-select --print-path`\r\n4. Use `/Applications/Xcode.app`\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing you have a `~/Library/Preferences/Xamarin/Settings.plist` file. The fix should be to remove that file (so that the build uses step 3. above instead).",

In case I find it, I will comment it here.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have unblocked our builds by manually selecting the macOS version. So the issue is not so urgent to fix for us at the moment. \r\n\r\nSo I think it should be OK to close this issue with this comment. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help!",
