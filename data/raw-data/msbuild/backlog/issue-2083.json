  "body": "We need an equivalent of $(MSBuildProjectFullPath) in the resolver context.  SdkResolverContext.ProjectFilePath is actually the path of the importing file, not the path to the project being built.  It turns out that if SolutionFilePath is unavailable and there are SDKs that import SDKs, then the CLI resolver has no way to pick all SDKs from a compatible version. See dotnet/cli#6553.\r\n\r\nI think SdkResolverContext.ProjectFilePath should be MSBuildProjectFullPath and a separate property SdkResolverContext.ImportingProjectFilePath should be used for the current meaning. \r\n\r\n@AndyGerlicher @dsplaisted @johnbeisner",
