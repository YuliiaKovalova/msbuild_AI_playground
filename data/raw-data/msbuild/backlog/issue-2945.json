  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nApologies if this noob question is in the wrong place but I couldn't find any other forum. Please let me know if there is a more suitable location for my query.\r\n\r\nI've followed the instructions to build msbuild.exe using VS2017 (branch 15.7):\r\n\r\ncibuild.cmd --target Full --scope Compile --bootstrap-only\r\n\r\nI get can it to build C# projects, however I get the following error when building a C++ project:\r\n\r\nerror MSB4019: The imported project \"~\\bin\\Bootstrap\\Common7\\IDE\\VC\\VCTargets\\Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props\" was not found.\r\n\r\nI'm running the version of msbuild in ~bin\\Bootstrap\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\r\n\r\nI assume $(VCTargetsPath) is not being defined correctly, but the VS2017 version of msbuild works fine in the same environment.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. BTW the documentation refers to cibuild.cmd (not present in the master branch) and BuildAndCopy.cmd (not present at all). \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
