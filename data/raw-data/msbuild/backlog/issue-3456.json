        "body": "This is not answerable in a nice general way, because any NuGet package, SDK, project, or import can define its own custom targets. In addition, there's no requirement that projects import `Microsoft.Common.targets`, so there's not even a common base of targets that you can 100% rely on.\r\n\r\nThe best way to see what targets are available in _your specific_ project is to [preprocess](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference#preprocess) it to a file and look for `<Target` elements. There's also an outstanding request to have a command-line option to list targets (#33) that hasn't bubbled up in priority yet.",
