  "body": "MSBuild's command line help text currently has varying camelCasing styles. Since it does accept any casing being applied.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are a lot of all-lowercase ones:\r\n* `/consoleloggerparameters`\r\n* `/fileloggerparameters`\r\n* `/noconsolelogger`\r\n* `/noautoresponse`\r\nmixed with camelCased ones:\r\n* `/fileLogger`\r\n* `/binaryLogger`\r\n* `/nodeReuse`\r\n* `/restoreProperty`\r\n\r\nMaybe the constants in https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/MSBuild/CommandLineSwitches.cs should also match the documented ones? they are all lowercase at the moment so at least that is consistent. (not sure if that results in a few nanoseconds saved during parsing)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like the help text and documentation to only use camelCase.",
