New folder, type \"dotnet new -t msbuild\"\n2. Type \"dotnet restore3\"\n\n**ACTUAL**\nRestore shows \"Build started\" and \"Build succeeded\" in the log. This might confuse end-users regarding why calling a 'restore' seems to invoke a 'build'. I initially thought it was the project getting built, then I realized that it's probably the standard output from MSBuild.\n\n[From Rob - Nuget team] They should consider changing the normal output of msbuild \u2026 perhaps they could use the target name that is executed, instead of always saying \"Build\".  Pack and Publish and Test will have the same problems.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8246794/19256187/59e87ba2-8f19-11e6-9110-7a7144ee14eb.png)\n",

        "body": "This isn't something we would consider changing in MSBuild. It is a build engine after all, so the messages are appropriate.\n\nIf you want to match the output in VS you can add `/nologo /verbosity:minimal` and those messages will not appear. I think that is probably the best route. Only high importance messages will show in the console and the Build, Pack, etc. can write their own `Pack succeeded` message when appropriate (high importance).\n\nThe other option is to write a custom logger for CLI and always use that for console output. This is fairly easy to do and output could be customized any way it's needed.\n",
