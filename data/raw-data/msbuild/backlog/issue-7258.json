  "title": "Use MSBuild from the .NET SDK within Visual Studio",
  "body": "Right now Visual Studio uses its own copy of the MSBuild libraries, which can result in behavioral differences with the one that the user has brought with their SDK.  To improve the consistency of results between the CLI and Visual Studio, we should align these versions in some way.  An easy initial pathway would be to ship .NET Framework MSBuild in the .NET SDK, for example.  Regardless, there will likely be work required to ensure compatibility between these disparate versions, which this issue will cover.",
