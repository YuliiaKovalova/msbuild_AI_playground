Maybe it was removed because nothing called it, or never got created. I assume it should be roughly equivalent, but with a call to `GetPlatformSDKLocation` instead of `GetPathToWindowsSdk`.\n\nWe shouldn't be causing and then suppressing warnings in our own code, and we _really_ shouldn't be causing compile errors due to obsolete methods that don't offer a replacement.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the best fix is to provide the new method or remove the obsolete tag. It'd probably take a bit of spelunking in the (old, internal) source history to figure out.\n",
