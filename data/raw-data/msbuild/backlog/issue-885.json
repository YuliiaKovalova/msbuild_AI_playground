The workaround would be to manually unescape the string in the UsingTask via the `[MSBuild]::Unescape` intrinsic property function.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that the MSBuild task escapes input seems to be out of sync with the MSBuild escaping policy with items and properties where users are expected to escape msbuild specific characters (and then the engine unescapes at various points). \r\n\r\n@Microsoft/msbuild-maintainers, should we consider changing the legacy behaviour?\r\n",
