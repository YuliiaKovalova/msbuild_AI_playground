        "body": "@chcosta used an instrumented MSBuild which helped isolate the problem: the `Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed` package contains:\r\n\r\n* SleetLib, which references\r\n  * NuGet at package version 4.3.0\r\n* NuGet at package version 5.3.0\r\n\r\nThe loader currently requires strict version matches\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/8aa0b87c00c6f26a565cf5e10975769dad9f378b/src/Shared/MSBuildLoadContext.cs#L71-L75\r\n\r\nSo when we try to load NuGet-as-referenced-from-Sleet, it fails because it can only find NuGet `5.3.0.4` and Sleet references `4.3.0.5`.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't a problem pre-ALC isolation, because we always loaded NuGet from the sdk root folder next to MSBuild. Now that's just a fallback, and the assemblies in the package match by simple name.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't yet understand is what happens after we try this and it fails. Why don't we then fall back to next-to-MSBuild?",
