  "body": "Apparently MSBuild uses environment variables to fill in it's properties. Xcode extensively uses environment to store various build information.

Unsetting `TARGETNAME` `TARGET_NAME` makes build failures go away.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time i am experiencing similar problem. Something in the past from Xcode also messed up environment, so until recently i did MacOS builds with `env -i` msbuild command prefix. Now that dotnet does need some environment variables this is no longer an option.\r\n\r\nProposed solution: a way to turn prevent msbuild from using environment variables for properties that are not related to setup of the environment.",
