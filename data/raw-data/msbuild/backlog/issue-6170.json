  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nBuilding the project system solution works when I'm making changes in VS but after some time the build starts failing with the error below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2>C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Microsoft.WinFx.targets(712,5): error BG1002: File 'D:\\dev\\repos\\project-system\\artifacts\\Debug\\obj\\Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Managed.VS\\ProjectSystem\\VS\\UI\\DontShowAgainMessageBox.baml' cannot be found.\r\n2>Done building project \"Microsoft.VisualStudio.ProjectSystem.Managed.VS.csproj\" -- FAILED.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitching to a command line build still results in the same error so it is not unique to Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/dotnet/project-system\r\n2. Run `build.cmd /diagnostic`\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.0-preview-21105-01+13de7ba2b for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

The problem is, somehow my machine stopped reproducing it after the 1st or 2nd try, and I couldn't save the binlog.\r\n\r\nCurrently still thinking it's a race condition of some kind.",
