  "title": "[Feature Request]: Make Exec task support new progress messages.",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nDesign and implement a (limited) progress messages support in the Exec task.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nWith the new progress messages API #10415, custom task authors would be able to have an improved logger experience. However, there are many builds that use the `Exec` task in order to execute some script, instead of writing a custom task. It would be beneficial to have some support for the new progress messages API for the `Exec` task users as well.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nSimilar to `CustomErrorRegularExpression` and `CustomWarningRegularExpression`, add `CustomProgressRegularExpression` to the Exec task parameters to provide a detection of messages that should be forwarded through the new progress messages API.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\nUp for a discussion.",
