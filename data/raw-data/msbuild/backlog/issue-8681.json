  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI have a problem with MSBuild an packages.\r\n\r\nI have an application referencing an assembly which references a package, which has \"contentFiles\" in it like:\r\n\r\nMain App A -> Assembly B -> Package C with assemblies and content files (exe + json)!\r\n\r\nThese content files are executables who are needed by the main application to run (remote api with pipes / proxy).\r\n\r\nProblem: \r\n\r\nMSBuild copies these exe-content files included in the package referenced by Assembly B not to the output folder of Main App A. They are only written to the output folder of Assembly B.\r\n\r\nIs there a solution or workaround?\r\n\r\nPackage C content:\r\n\r\n<a href='https://postimages.org/' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/3RqdK5JK/2023-04-20-13-49-15-Nu-Get-Package-Explorer-Legacy-Wrapper-1-0-60.png' border='0' alt='2023-04-20-13-49-15-Nu-Get-Package-Explorer-Legacy-Wrapper-1-0-60'/></a>\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nBuild an application referencing an assembly which references a package with content files in it.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nMain application output folder has content files of an **Package C** in it.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nMain application does not have  content files of **Package C**  referenced by **Assembly B** in it's output folder.\r\n\r\n### Ask us questions\r\n\r\nWhich setting mus i do in the .csproj to achieve my goal?",
