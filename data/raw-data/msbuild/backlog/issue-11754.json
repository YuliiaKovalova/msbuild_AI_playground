  "title": "[Performance]: Use graph build in dotnet/dotnet repo",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nFix scheduling issues in https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet repository. \nThe critical path is about 30% shorter than the actual builds and a lot of MSBuild nodes are not utilized efficiently.\nSome part of the scheduling issues could be addressed by switching to the graph build, see https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/pull/160. \n\nHowever, CI is failing for this PR. Fix the graph build and measure the impact of the change.\n",
