  "body": "Add BuildCheck run notifications to msbuild output, even if no checks failed.\nInclude package name in output so it can be tracked in case of malicious package.\n\nThis is recommendation from our security leaders. This shall increase discoverability and awareness what BuildChecks packages have had run during build, so user can easily detect abnormal or unexpected behavior.\n\n@baronfel We have to design how to align this request with terminal logger minimal verbosity model. There were reasoning that since BuildCheck from CLI will be opt-in (mostly by CLI argument) and from practical point of view rare, we can afford to include this in summary - provided some buildcheck have had actually run.",
