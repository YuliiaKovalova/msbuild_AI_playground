When users specify `/binarylogger` to MSBuild.exe, there is currently no way for static graph-based restore to detect that the binary logger is enabled and automatically emit a binlog for restore.  The binary logger sets some environment variables already, it might as well set one more indicating that the current build episode is using the binary logger.\r\n\r\n",
