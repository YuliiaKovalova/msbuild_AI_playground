  "title": "Add ability to ignore invalid imports",
  "body": "Similar to #1727, we should add a `ProjectLoadSettings.IgnoreInvalidImports` which will evaluate a project even if one or more imports have invalid XML or something else wrong with them.\r\n\r\nFrom @jviau \r\n> I am wondering if we can even go a step further and have a way to handle/ignore invalid imports. I implemented a feature for CPS to auto-reload changed imports on disk, and to revert back to in-memory XML if the import is now invalid. The problem is I can't deal with the case where a condition import transitions from false to true and the newly imported file is invalid. My system relies on file changed notifications, and there is no way to know that some arbitrary change is going to bring in a new invalid import.",
