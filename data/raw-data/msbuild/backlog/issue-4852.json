From what I can tell, a breaking change for 3.0.100. Note that I also defined `<Compile Remove=\"templates\\*.cs\" />`.\r\n\r\n@rainersigwald to be honest, this is really frustrating. I tried catching up with the latest releases, but those [embedded resource related issues](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/4742) have been worked on at the latest possible time. ",
