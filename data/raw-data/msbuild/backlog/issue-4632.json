The difficulty is that if you want to display a localized error message, you need to know the culture, and if the culture doesn't exist...the error propagates.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/compare/master...Forgind:en-pk-bug\r\nis not an ideal solution because it doesn't clearly identify the problem, but the best alternative I currently see is to have it default to en-us, printing an error message in English for everyone and ignoring localization.",
