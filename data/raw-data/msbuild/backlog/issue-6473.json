  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nIf I set several MSBuild warnings to errors via MSBuildWarningsAsErrors and WarningsAsErrors and build with Visual Studio, VS will successfully build and output the warnings, that should be errors, as normal warnings. Here are the settings. You can get the project to reproduce the error at https://github.com/MattBussing/vs-issue-example.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<MSBuildWarningsAsErrors>MSB3276;MSB3247;MSB3277;NU1605;MSB3245;MSB3243</MSBuildWarningsAsErrors>\r\n<WarningsAsErrors>MSB3276;MSB3247;MSB3277;NU1605;MSB3245;MSB3243</WarningsAsErrors>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n- Checkout this repo https://github.com/MattBussing/vs-issue-example\r\n- Open ConsoleApp1.sln \r\n- Rebuild\r\n- Check the Error List and the Build Output pane\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe build to fail in VS and output MSB3247 as an error.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n#### VS\r\nHere it doesn't fail. It just warns about the issue.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31907187/119183698-b0f5e180-ba31-11eb-9412-29aa10eee879.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31907187/119183728-b8b58600-ba31-11eb-8bf0-49e7c454667a.png)\r\n\r\n#### Rider\r\nRider actually fails.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31907187/119183919-f4e8e680-ba31-11eb-9f8c-ef1e63f065e1.png)\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n#### VS\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2019\r\nVersion 16.9.4\r\nMSBuild 16.9.0.16703\r\n#### Rider\r\nJetBrains Rider 2021.1.2\r\nBuild #RD-211.7142.19, built on April 22, 2021\r\nRuntime version: 11.0.10+9-b1341.41 amd64\r\nVM: Dynamic Code Evolution 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o.\r\nWindows 10 10.0\r\n.NET Framework 4.0.30319.42000",
