  "title": "MSBuild doesnt make reference to shared data sources in SSRS",
  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\ni tried to automatize deploy process of my rptproj project by using msbuild.exe\r\nI have several reports, that has references to shared datasource and also shared data sets. When i deploy project via Visual Studio, everything is fine. When i use msbuild, it ends up with this error:\r\n\r\n    warning : The dataset `RPT' refers to the shared data source `RPT', which is not published on the report server.  The shared data source `RPT' must be published before this report can run.\r\n\r\nBut, this problem is only when i want to put shared data sources and data sets into the folders. This is what i run from command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSBuild.exe \"Reports.rptproj\" /target:Deploy /p:TargetServerUrl=http://localhost/ReportServer /p:TargetDatasetFolder=Datasets /p:TargetDataSourceFolder=\"Data Sources\" /p:TargetReportFolder=Reports /p:TargetReportPartFolder=\"Report Parts\" /p:OverwriteDataSources=False /p:OverwriteDatasets=False\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything is deployed fine, but references are missing. When i use Visual Studio deploy, everything is fine. Reports are in folder, data sets are in folder, data source also and references are created.\r\n\r\nWhen i dont use parameters TargetDatasetFolder, TargetDataSourceFolder, TargetReportFolder then also references are good, but everything is deployed into root which i dont want.\r\n\r\nIt is there something that i miss? I cant find proper documentation. Also tried catch what visual studio run under the hood during deploy, with no luck.",
