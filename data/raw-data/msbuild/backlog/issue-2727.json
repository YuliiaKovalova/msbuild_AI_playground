  "body": "There are numerous references in the code base to _NTDRIVE and _NTROOT. This is from our legacy razzle build system in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought this was just hold over from that time and that we had shimmed the values in some way. But looking through the code I can't see anywhere we shim the values. Instead the values seem to be always unset and hence resulting in a lot of invalid imports in the code. Example:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n <Import Project=\"$(_NTDRIVE)$(_NTROOT)\\tools\\Microsoft.DevDiv.Settings.targets\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this code just dead and hanging around for no reason? Or do we still build this code via razzle in some configuration? \r\n",
