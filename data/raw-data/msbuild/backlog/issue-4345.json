  "body": "I realise that this bug is probably a little OT.. but SSDT doesn't have a repository to log a bug against.. and it does impact my msbuild scripts...\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd an SSDT (sqlproj) project to the solution. run the build step. sqlproj outputs messages that aren't that interesting or necessary even though I've set my build to minimal verbosity.\r\n\r\nCommand line\r\n```\r\nmsbuild x.sln /v:minimal\r\n```\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nI don't want any 'info' type logging to be output\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe following messages are output:\r\n\r\n* Creating a model to represent the project...\r\n* Loading project references...\r\n* Loading project files...\r\n* Building the project model and resolving object interdependencies...\r\n* Validating the project model...\r\n* Writing model to  ... \\Model.xml...\r\n\r\nI have tracked down the issue to Microsoft.Data.Tools.Schema.Tasks.Sql.TaskHostLoader.LogMessage(), which is passing 0 as the importance level, which is mapped to 'High'..\r\n\r\n```\r\ninternal static void LogMessage(TaskLoggingHelper providedLogger, string msg)\r\n{\r\n    providedLogger.LogMessage(0, msg, Array.Empty<object>());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that all logging from within SSDT is highly important, which it definitely is not..",
