  "body": ".NET Source-Build relies on overriding package version properties to build projects with the latest versions of all dependencies. Using hardcoded package versions (e.g. `6.0.0` instead of `SystemCollectionsImmutableVersion`), we end up pulling prebuilts from the internet. The proper solution is to declare properties for package versions in `eng/Versions.props`, and reference those properties from `eng/Packages.props`. The proper format for the properties is the full package version name without periods followed by \"Version\", some of the dependencies in this file already follow that pattern.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/c1b61ebeaa0f77d1382c6a0734024557ecf255c3/eng/Packages.props#L13-L29",

I'm researching workarounds for the dependabot issue right now for msbuild as well as [dotnet/templating](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/blob/main/eng/dependabot/Packages.props). This is being tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2933. If you have any ideas I'd love to hear them.",
