The process cannot access the file 'D:\\a\\1\\s\\src\\Tasks\\system.design\\system.design.txt' because it is being used by another process.\r\n```\r\n\r\nToday I looked into it. I suspect this flow of things:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/797fd829a374a880f63fd4eea4ea6990404c48f4/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L3561-L3565\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/797fd829a374a880f63fd4eea4ea6990404c48f4/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L3876-L3877\r\n\r\n`File.Open` does not specify `FileShare.Read`, which defaults to \"no sharing\". So if this is run on the same file in parallel (for instance, in our Tasks project which is multitargeted), there's a possibility that the second attempt to read the file fails because the first one is still holding a lock.",
