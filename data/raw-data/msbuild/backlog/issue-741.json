  "title": "Build generates multiple tlog folders",
  "body": "When building my project, I'm getting a warning from MSBuild saying:\n\n```\nMSB8028: The intermediate directory (<intermediate directory here>) contains files shared from another project (<project name here>)\n```\n\nWhat's interesting is the shared project name is the exact same as the project I'm currently building. Upon investigation into the folder it complains about, I noticed MSBuild is sometimes creating multiple tlog folders. Since the name of my project is long, the folder hierarchy looks something like this:\n\n```\n|-IntermediateDir\n    |-MyProjectNameIsL.123454678.tlog\n    |-MyProjectNameIsL.ABCDEFGH.tlog\n```\n\nNote that MyProjectNameIsL is not a typo, it is to exemplify the length of my project's name and why MSBuild appears to serialize it. For the purpose of this question the name of the project is MyProjectNameIsLong.\n\nIf I delete these folders, it works fine for the first build but reports a warning for the second. It appears that MSBuild forgets about the existence of the original tlog folder and just creates a new one. Why is this the case?\n",

Do you perhaps have multiple projects with the same name prefix and different project GUIDs?\n\nThe C++ targets aren't open source and are supported by the C++ team, not the MSBuild team that works in this repo, so the best thing to do would be to use [their support channels](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/support/support-overview-vs.aspx). But the `IgnoreWarnIntDirSharingDetected` property looks interesting . . .\n",
