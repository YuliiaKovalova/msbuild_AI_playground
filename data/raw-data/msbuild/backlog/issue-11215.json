  "body": "IsBuilderUsingLegacyThreadingSemantics is an old concession to visual studio. It is making a mess out of RequestBuilder.cs and it is anchoring us to some old stuff we would like to get rid of. (There are bunch of weird legacy behaviors linked to this function)\n\nWhen we have Telemetry ready, it would be awesome to add a point here to check if it is still in use and if not, burn it with fire.",
