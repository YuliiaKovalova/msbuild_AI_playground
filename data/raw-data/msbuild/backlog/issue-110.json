  "body": "After building the project for command line, a few issues I was facing was the conflict between the Powershell to figure out what `msbuild` was, Running `msbuild` says `Command 'msbuild.exe' cannot be found.` whereas `msbuild` is actually present, At the same time I have to run `msbuild.exe` for `msbuild` to be executed to execute the pre installed `MsBuild` from the installed `Framework/vXXXXXXX`. Executing `msbuild` from absolute path works fine.\n\nDoes building the solution automatically remove `msbuild` from the path ?\n",

The \"Developer Command Prompt for VS2015\" is what I would recommend (or the equivalent for VS2013) and that will have MSBuild in the path. But once you build, you will have to use the full path name to the built exe to use that, it is not added to your path.\n",
