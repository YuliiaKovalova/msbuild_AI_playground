  "title": "Project builds for a 3rd party VS language integration (Synergy DBL) don't occur in parallel (cross post)",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nCross post from [here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1226188/project-builds-for-3rd-party-language-wont-occur-i.html) in case this ends up being the better spot for it.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nOur project system is implemented using MPF so there's a bit of custom implementation. Combing through commits in a couple of repos (including F#) suggest that the only thing that needs to be implemented on the VS side is  `ProjectConfig.GetBuildCfgProperty` and setting the out var to true if the property being passed in is `VSBLDCFGPROPID_SupportsMTBuild`/`-16000`. Inspecting the VS diagnostic build output from our implementation indicates the projects still aren't building in parallel. Building the solution from the command line with msbuild and the `-m` flag does build the projects in parallel (visable in structured log viewer).\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nWith project builds occurring in parallel from the command line, I'd rule out our custom target and task implementations as a failure point. I did break in one of our tasks and `BuildInParallel` was set to true on the task's build engine. As far as I can tell at this point, either there's an implementation detail wrong/missing in our project system or VS isn't interfacing with msbuild correctly to start parallel project builds for us. A test build in F# shows parallel builds occurring in VS diagnostic output. I've attached a VS log, msbuild binary log, and the VS setting showing multiple projects are allowed to build concurrently.",
