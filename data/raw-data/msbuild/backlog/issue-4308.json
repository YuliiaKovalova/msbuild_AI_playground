  "body": "_From @dsplaisted on Tuesday, 29 January 2019 01:54:52_\r\n\r\nRight now for our tests (and in the dogfood script) we override the MSBuildSDKsPath to point MSBuild to the SDK under test.  However, this doesn't seem to prevent sharing MSBuild nodes that didn't have this set, which can end up causing assembly loading or other issues.\r\n\r\nIdeally in our test environment we would add a \"salt\" to the node connection handshake, so that MSBuild would only be able to connect to nodes that come from the same test environment.\r\n\r\nThis would probably require a change in MSBuild to allow us to provide such a \"salt\".\r\n\r\n@rainersigwald, thoughts?\r\n\r\n_Copied from original issue: dotnet/sdk#2880_",

I don't think it's generally useful, but for internal development and especially tests that require multiple invocations and need node reuse to be enabled it'd be nice.",

Because of this, we have to disable node reuse for our tests, to avoid them connecting to a stage 0 node.",
