  "body": "<!-- NOTE: The MSBuild team receives a lot of issues and we need to prioritize them accordingly.

Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n* Here are some useful links to help you figure out what's wrong.\r\n* Our wiki: https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/Home.md\r\n* General Help: https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/Something's-wrong-in-my-build.md\r\n* Tips & Tricks: https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/MSBuild-Tips-%26-Tricks.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n<!--\r\n* Please include a clear and concise description of the problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe are in the process of upgrading a lot of our projects to .NET 6 from .NET Framework, but we need to keep them multi-targeted largely because the process of upgrading them all will take sometime so we cannot interrupt with the day to day workings on the application until every component has been updated.\r\n\r\nA project that we had was registered for COM, etc. But from what I have read is that regasm does not work for .NET Core, so consequently the tag RegisterForComInterop does not work for .NET 6.\r\n\r\nSo we conditionally put the RegisterForComInterop declaration for the .NET Framework target output (see project file snippet)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following if possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n\r\nIf providing steps to reproduce the issue proves difficult, consider attaching a binlog:\r\n[Details on sharing binary logs](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog)\r\n[More information on binary logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md)\r\nNOTE: Binary logs capture environment information. Ensure it does not include any information you don't want to be public before you attach one.\r\nIf you want to share one just with Microsoft, you can [report a problem through Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report) and share it privately with Microsoft.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe following is the project file:\r\n\r\n```<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\t<PropertyGroup>\r\n\t\t<TargetFrameworks>net6.0-windows;net462</TargetFrameworks>\r\n\t\t<OutputType>Library</OutputType>\r\n\t\t<RootNamespace>ComponentABC</RootNamespace>\r\n\t\t<GenerateAssemblyInfo>false</GenerateAssemblyInfo>\r\n\t\t<UseWPF>true</UseWPF>\r\n\t\t<ImportWindowsDesktopTargets>true</ImportWindowsDesktopTargets>\r\n\t</PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net462'\">\r\n\t\t<RegisterForComInterop>true</RegisterForComInterop>\r\n\t</PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<PropertyGroup Condition=\" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Debug|AnyCPU' \">\r\n\t\t<DebugSymbols>true</DebugSymbols>\r\n\t\t<OutputPath>..\\..\\bin\\</OutputPath>\r\n\t</PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<PropertyGroup Condition=\" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|AnyCPU' \">\r\n\t\t<OutputPath>..\\..\\bin\\</OutputPath>\r\n\t</PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net462'\">\r\n        <!-- References omitted from this snippet as it should be irrelevant to the issue on hand.-->\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n\t<ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0-windows'\">\r\n        <!-- References omitted from this snippet as it should be irrelevant to the issue on hand.-->\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* Include what you are trying to do, and the expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen we run dotnet pack on this project it should generate a NuGet Package correctly without any errors.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* Include the actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen we run **dotnet pack** on this project we receive the following error:\r\n\r\n`C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.100\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1420,5): error MSB4062: The \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.UnregisterAssembly\" task could not be loaded from the assembly Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.
