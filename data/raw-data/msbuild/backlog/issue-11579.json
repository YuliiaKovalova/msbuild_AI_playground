  "body": "### Describe the bug\nSince .net9 files with \"<CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\" are no longer copied to the outputfolder if the path of the projectfolder or any folder above it contains a \"@\". We found this behavior on our jenkins, because he creates for each worker a folder containing a \"@\".\n\n\n### To Reproduce\n1. Create a folder like \"test@dotnet\"\n2. Create a new dotnet console application\n3. add a file with \"copy always\"\n4. build\n5. => the file isnt copied\n\nworkarounds\noption 1\ncreate a global.json force to dotnet 8 sdk and retry\noption 2\nremove the \"@\" from the foldername",
