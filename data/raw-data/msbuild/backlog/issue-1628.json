We're essentially doing the following in our code -\r\n```\r\nvar project = new Microsoft.Build.Evaluation.Project(projectName);\r\nvar evaluatedIncludes = project.Items.Select(x => x.EvaluatedInclude);\r\n```\r\nWe're doing this to find the additional files in the project. The reason to choose MSBuild over other possible solutions was that the additional files added to project have <Visible>False</Visible> attribute and other solutions cannot enumerate these files. This works perfectly fine with other .NET framework projects.",
