  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nAfter reading https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/11673 i found out about MSBUILDENABLEBUILDPLAN. A feature which is supposed to write a file with the build times of projects to be able to optimize the build order on the next run.\n\nAn example of a .buildplan file that is generated.\n```\n2 530.2654 /home/user/Projects/ConsoleApp17/ConsoleApp17/ConsoleApp17.csproj\n3 130.588 /home/user/Projects/ConsoleApp17/ClassLibrary2/ClassLibrary2.csproj\n4 188.4428 /home/user/Projects/ConsoleApp17/ClassLibrary1/ClassLibrary1.csproj\n\n2 3 3 3\n3\n3 4 4 4\n4\n4\n4\n3\n```\n\nBuilding the project again leads to an error in the log that the buildplan is invalid.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n- Create any project\n- Set MSBUILDENABLEBUILDPLAN to 1\n- run `dotnet msbuild AnyProject -bl:binlog.binlog` twice\n- observe error at the end of the binlog that the buildplan is invalid\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt works\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt does not work\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe buildplan is read [here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Scheduler/SchedulingPlan.cs#L135)\n[Here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Scheduler/SchedulingPlan.cs#L403) it reads the lines and splits based on semicolon. Problem: The file does not contain any semicolons.\n\nAfter some digging around i think found the commit that introduced the bug:\nIn [PR 4079](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/4079/files#diff-8d669fb4d66fce73a89f3e6d364202f6095860780cacce11fa3561a6ab79a9fbR507) `new char[] { ' ' }` is replaced with `MSBuildConstants.SemicolonChar` while it should have been `MSBuildConstants.SpaceChar`\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nFedora Linux\ndotnet msbuild 17.12.24.6604 (from fedora repos)",
