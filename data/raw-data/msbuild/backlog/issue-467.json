What I mean by resolved locally is when an assembly is [**not** resolved through the GAC](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/XMakeTasks/AssemblyDependency/Reference.cs#L489-L495) (i.e. `ResolvedFromGac = false`). So for example if you have a project reference or an explicit HintPath, your build output will not be determined by having the assembly in the GAC or not because it was resolved \"locally\" (`ResolvedFromGac = false`).\n",
