  "body": "### Issue Description\n\n[EmitBundleBase](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/542983327f61706b2ed07583601861846361364b/src/tasks/MonoTargetsTasks/EmitBundleTask/EmitBundleBase.cs#L153-L154) task in `dotnet/runtime` uses `IBuildEngine9.RequestCores`, and depends on these being released when the task's `Execute` is done. But if the task is batched, then for any subsequent invocations the task gets blocked on `RequestCores`. If I use `ReleaseCores` before returning from `Execute`, then it works fine.\r\n\r\nIs this the expected behavior?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nQuestion about the expected behavior\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nresource `cores` get released automatically at the end of a task\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nresource `cores` are not released between batched task runs.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
