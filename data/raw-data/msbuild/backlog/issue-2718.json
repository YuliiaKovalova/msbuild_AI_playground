  "title": "Need clearer documentation on how to build msbuild for Mono",
  "body": "I have been trying to compile msbuild v15 targeting Mono for a couple days now and I could use some help. I am compiling on CentOS 7 and after struggling with various issues I have finally gotten `./cibuild.sh --target Mono` to complete (seemingly) successfully. But now I am stuck. The documentation is not clear what the output of this script is supposed to be. I am currently working on the assumption that it creates `bin/Debug-MONO/AnyCPU/Unix/Unix_Deployment/` but it's not clear what I should do with the contents of this directory. The msbuild.sh in there always fails with error `msbuild.sh: line 4: /scratch/bmishkania/msbuild-15.4.8.50001/bin/Debug-MONO/AnyCPU/Unix/Unix_Deployment/dotnetcli/dotnet: No such file or directory`. I also tried using the MSBuild.dll there as follows: `mono MSBuild.dll` and when trying to build my project it failed with error `The \"*.tasks\" files could not be successfully loaded from their expected location`.\r\n\r\nCan someone please tell me what I am doing wrong here?",
