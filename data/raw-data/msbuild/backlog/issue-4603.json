[Adding `FileUtilities.NormalizePath`](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/4414/files) caused https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/4593 . It is fixed by adding [skip when the path is not valid](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/4598). However, we should consider trim the hintpath in 17.0 since it is more close to what the customer want.",
