  "body": "In order to automate taking new msbuild builds, msbuild should write a build info file to https://github.com/dotnet/versions/tree/master/build-info/.  This allows any team to get notifications when a new build is available, and the team can write automation that creates an automatic PR for their repo to take the new msbuild build.\n\nSee the documentation https://github.com/dotnet/versions#net-versions and https://github.com/dotnet/versions/tree/master/Maestro#maestro.\n\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/versions/blob/master/build-info/dotnet/roslyn/netcore1.0/Latest_Packages.txt as an example.\n\nThere are two options available in dotnet/buildtools that allow an easy way to write these files:\n- an MSBuild task: https://github.com/dotnet/buildtools/blob/fix-unix-runner-verbosity/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks/PackageFiles/VersionTools.targets\n- a .NET Core library: https://github.com/dotnet/buildtools/blob/master/src/Microsoft.DotNet.VersionTools/Automation/VersionsRepoUpdater.cs\n\nDuring an official build, you can invoke this code that will write out a new build-info file to dotnet/versions.  Talk to @eerhardt or @dagood for more information.\n",
