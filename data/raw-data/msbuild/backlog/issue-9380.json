Currently MSBuild team knows about various undesirable usage patterns, but have a little way of flagging those - in order not to break customers.\r\n\r\n### Some already collected ideas:\r\n\r\n* [[Internal link] potential analyzer ideas](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:o:/t/DotNetTeam/EtSEoqLsusZNt0gLT0rGHS0BZ9ypO0Ad94TiqQLtnHEGNA?e=VzUqkM)\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Feature%3A+Warning+Waves%22+\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Area%3A+Debuggability%22\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\n* Collect requirements - mainly in regards of *what* should be analyzed, but as well ideas on *how* and *when* or even *how to extend / plug-in*\r\n* Based on those put together quick informal design and run it through with PM/team - arrive to some conclusion on proposed design\r\n* Create quick prototype/spike demonstratng the idea and few sample (may be dummy) built-in analyzer rules and idealy a pluggable rule\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n- [x] #9421\r\n- [x] #9422\r\n- [x] #9460",
