  "title": "[Bug]: PackageReference with Content fails to build rather than warn with NU1701",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nGiven a consumer project, ProjectConsumer (with TargetFramework netstandard2.0) that PackageReferences a project with Content, ProjectWithContent, (with TargetFrameworks net48;net6.0) and another project without Content, ProjectWithoutContent, (also with TargetFrameworks net48;net6.0), ProjectConsumer fails to compile with \"error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'ProjectWithContent' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly.\" On the other hand, ProjectWithoutContent compiles with warning NU1701.\r\n\r\nNote that if ProjectWithContent and ProjectWithoutContent are ProjectReferenced rather than PackageReferenced, ProjectConsumer builds with warning. This leads me to suspect the issue could involve NuGet.\r\n\r\nIf there is a fundamental issue why a project with content cannot be PackageReferenced this way, it would be nice to have a more descriptive error message.\r\n\r\nThanks!\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nSample project to reproduce issue: https://github.com/edmfgh/PackageReferenceBug/tree/main\r\n\r\n1. \"dotnet pack\" both ProjectWithContent and ProjectWithoutContent, e.g., \"dotnet pack .\\ProjectWithContent.csproj\" -o <output folder>\r\n2. Add <output folder> as a NuGet source\r\n3. Ensure ProjectConsumer references ProjectWithContent and ProjectWithoutContent via PackageReference\r\n4. Build ProjectConsumer\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nProjectConsumer builds with warnings that ProjectWithContent and ProjectWithoutContent may not fully be compatible with your project, ProjectConsumer.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nProjectConsumer fails to compile with \"error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'ProjectWithContent' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\"\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nSDK 8.0.101\r\nMSBuild version 17.8.3+195e7f5a3 for .NET, 17.8.3.51904\r\nIDE Agnostic",
