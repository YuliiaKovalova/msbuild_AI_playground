  "body": "\n## Problem\n\nRoslyn build from Visual Studio intermittently fails with error:\n\n```\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.100-rc.2.24474.11\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets(355,5): error MSB3030: Could not copy the file \"D:\\github\\roslyn\\artifacts\\obj\\InteractiveHost64\\Debug\\net472\\win-x64\\InteractiveHost64.exe.config\" because it was not found. [D:\\github\\roslyn\\src\\Interactive\\HostProcess\\x64\\InteractiveHost64.csproj]\n```\n\nThis is caused by the following sequence of events:\n\n1) Roslyn.VisualStudio.Setup.csproj invokes build of InteractiveHost64.csproj with entry target `PublishedProjectOutputGroup`, which depends on target `PublishItemsOutputGroup`.\n2) Roslyn.VisualStudio.Setup.csproj invokes build of InteractiveHost64.csproj with entry target `PublishVsixItems`, which depends on target `Publish` and transitively also on `PublishItemsOutputGroup`.\n3) \n\n`PublishItemsOutputGroup` depends on `ResolveReferences`, which depends on `GenerateBindingRedirects`.\n\n`GenerateBindingRedirects` has condition `'$(BuildingProject)' == 'true'\"`. \n\n`BuildingProject` property is set by `BuildOnlySettings` in various targets that need to build assets (`Build`, `Publish`, etc.). However, `BuildOnlySettings` is not set by `PublishItemsOutputGroup` as this target should only determine the items to be published but not publish them.\n\nThe invocation of `PublishItemsOutputGroup` in [1] skips generation of binding redirects (`BuildingProject` is `false') and the second invocation is skipped because the target already executed. As a result the App.config file is never written to and the build subsequently fails to copy the file.\n\nBinlog: [RoslynVSBuild.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17548484/RoslynVSBuild.zip)\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nIt doesn't seem like `ResolveReferences` should depend on the content of the generated App.config file. It should therefore not depend on `GenerateBindingRedirects` target:\n\n```xml\n <!--\n    ============================================================\n                                        ResolveReferences\n    ============================================================\n    -->\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <ResolveReferencesDependsOn>\n      BeforeResolveReferences;\n      AssignProjectConfiguration;\n      ResolveProjectReferences;\n      FindInvalidProjectReferences;\n      ResolveNativeReferences;\n      ResolveAssemblyReferences;\n      GenerateBindingRedirects;  <!-- Should be removed -->\n      GenerateBindingRedirectsUpdateAppConfig;\n      ResolveComReferences;\n      AfterResolveReferences\n    </ResolveReferencesDependsOn>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n```",
