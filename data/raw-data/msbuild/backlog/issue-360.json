  "body": "This one's a combination of layers of bad behavior.\n- When invoked on the command line with no project argument, we [search](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/07a15cfe9974dc1f558b8b0346a15ab375ee93a4/src/XMakeCommandLine/XMake.cs#L2061) for `.sln` files in the current working directory.\n- That search is performed using [`Directory.GetFiles`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wz42302f%28v=vs.110%29.aspx), which uses Windows APIs to do wildcard expansion on `\"*.sln\"`.\n- Those Windows APIs (as documented in that link) have \"interesting\" legacy behavior--if _exactly three characters_ are specified after a dot at the end of the pattern, that pattern will match _any extension that starts with those three characters_ and otherwise matches the pattern.\n\nAs a result, @zjrunner encountered a bug when there was a file named `something.slnhash` in the current directory.  MSBuild tried to build it, then failed to parse.\n\nWe should be defensive about this and double-check the results of `Directory.GetFiles` to make sure we're really only getting `*.sln` in the literal/UNIX sense.\n",
