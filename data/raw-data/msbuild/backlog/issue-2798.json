  "body": "WPF team is planning a fix to PresentationBuildTasks.dll that will provide _TargetAssemblyProjectName so that Microsoft.common.targets and Microsoft.common.props will be able to properly import $(_TargetAssemblyProjectName).g.props and .g.targets.\r\nI will submit a PR for that, when the other fix is in. I hope to be able to target 15.6 with that fix.",
