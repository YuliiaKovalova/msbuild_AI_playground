Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\nThe new-and-improved process detection logic in BuildEnvironmentHelper confuses tests, which run a \"fake\" 64-bit MSBuild.exe in an x86 process.\r\n\r\nThe detection logic:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BenVillalobos/msbuild/blob/525eebc0f31f8c770ad7b1636866aa2a15850e41/src/Shared/BuildEnvironmentHelper.cs#L540-L546\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nUn-skip the relevant tests that were disabled in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/7550 and run tests.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n",
