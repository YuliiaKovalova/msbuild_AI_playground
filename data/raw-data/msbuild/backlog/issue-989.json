  "body": "A project with multiple items with CopyToOutputDirectory and conflicting assigned TargetPaths will cause the last file to be copied to the TargetPath. \n\nI'm not certain this is a bug, but the behavior seems non-intuitive. It seems like multiple files trying to output to the same TargetPath should cause an error. \n\nAn example:\n\n```\n<Project ToolsVersion=\"14.0\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\n  <Import Project=\"$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\\Microsoft.Common.props\" />\n\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\n    <TargetFrameworkIdentifier>.NETCoreApp</TargetFrameworkIdentifier>\n    <TargetFrameworkVersion>v1.0</TargetFrameworkVersion>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <Compile Include=\"**\\*.cs\" Exclude=\"$(GlobalExclude)\" />\n    <EmbeddedResource Include=\"**\\*.resx\" Exclude=\"$(GlobalExclude)\" />\n    <Content Include=\"Program.cs;project.json\">\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\n      <Link>otherfilename.json</Link>\n    </Content>\n  </ItemGroup>\n\n  <Import Project=\"$(MSBuildToolsPath)\\Microsoft.CSharp.targets\" />\n</Project>\n```\n\nonly`project.json` will be copied to `otherfilename.json` and no error is thrown.\n\ncc @rainersigwald @cdmihai @eerhardt\n",

It makes no sense that two different files are copied into one!! So i think it should throw an error if there are two files and the `<Link>` option is selected.\n\nFor example\nOk\n\n```\n<Content Include=\"Class1.cs;Class2.cs\">\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\n    </Content>  \n```\n\nShould throw error\n\n```\n<Content Include=\"Class1.cs;Class2.cs\">\n      <Link>Test1.cs</Link>\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\n    </Content>  \n```\n",

The _general_ problem (many files could be copied to the same destination path) is hard to deal with (MSBuild doesn't track all outputs from every task, which would be necessary to detect a conflict), but this specific case should be catchable, because it's all happening within [a single call to the `Copy` task](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/XMakeTasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L4123-L4135).\n\nThis situation will become more common as more folks start using globs.\n\nWould anyone object if I changed the title to \"`Copy` Task should error on duplicate destination paths\"?\n",
