  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nMSB3822 Seems to check for the existence of a reference to `System.Resources.Extensions` (when using non-string resources) but fails to see the reference when it is contained in a conditional `ItemGroup`. This is necessary, for example, when multi-targeting, since for .NET Core 3.1 I need a `PackageReference`, but for .NET Framework, a reference is already present by default.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nMulti-target .NET Core (3.1) and .NET Framework (4.0)\r\neg: `<TargetFrameworks>net40;netcoreapp3.1</TargetFrameworks>`\r\n\r\nConditionally add the PackageReference for .NET Core 3.1\r\neg:\r\n`<ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netcoreapp3.1'\">`\r\n`   <PackageReference Include=\"System.Resources.Extensions\" Version=\"5.0.0\" />`\r\n`</ItemGroup>`\r\n\r\n(can also use `!= 'net40'`)\r\n\r\nNote that I am sure the comparison is correct, because otherwise the `PackageReference` would be included in the `net40` build, and if it is, then you get incompatibility errors.\r\n\r\nAlso have a non-string resource present. This is a Windows Forms class library. Some other possibly important information:\r\n`<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop\">`\r\n...\r\n`<Platforms>x86</Platforms>`\r\n`<UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms>`\r\n`<EmbeddedResourceUseDependentUponConvention>false</EmbeddedResourceUseDependentUponConvention>`\r\n`<GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources>true</GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources>`\r\n\r\nThe latter tag is also required for non-string resources. Adding that tag leads to MSB3822.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nUnless I'm missing something, the above reference should be sufficient and I should not be getting MSB3822 in this situation. If I instead only target `netcoreapp3.1` and remove the `Condition` attribute, then the build works ok. It seems to miss the reference when it is conditional.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nA false MSB3822 error.",

        "body": "The error is firing correctly. The reference to `System.Resources.Extensions` is required for any target framework version when the resources are embedded using the new \"preserialized\" resource format. That format is the only one supported by the .NET (Core) SDK.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to file a bug at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime asking for .NET 4.0 support for System.Resources.Extensions. Today, if you want to build a project that targets .NET 4.0, you must use the older resource serialization strategy and build with `MSBuild.exe` from Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Build Tools); you cannot use the .NET SDK to embed non-string resources in a .NET 4.0 assembly.",
