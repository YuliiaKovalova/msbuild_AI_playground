I would have expected that should be forbidden.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nSee the attached solution below. If you build the .NET 6 or .NET Standard library, the build still succeeds.\r\n\r\n[TestImports.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/8723183/TestImports.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe Build should fail and say you should not reference a .NET Framework library from a .NET 6 library\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe Build succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nVS 2022 - 17.0.2\r\n",
