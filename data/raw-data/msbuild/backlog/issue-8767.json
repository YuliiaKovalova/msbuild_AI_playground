  "title": "[Bug]: Build Issue - Unit tests for the Copy task are redundantly executed",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThe unit tests for the Copy tasks are in several different class types. The `CopyHardLink_Tests`, `CopyNotHardLink_Tests`, `CopySingleThreaded_Tests`, and `CopySymbolicLink_Tests` classes derive from `Copy_Tests`. All of the tests in the base class also run as part of each derived class. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run unit tests, e.g. `./build.sh --test` or `build.cmd -test`\r\n2. In artifacts/TestResults open the Microsoft.Build.Tasks.UnitTests_*_*.html file(s).\r\n3. Search for the `InvalidRetryCount` test and note that the test was run 5 times.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSee Analysis\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nSee Analysis\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nClass inheritance was used to handle running a given test with different behavior flags. But there is a mixture of tests with different dependencies on the behavior flags. The `InvalidRetryCount` test, as an example, doesn't change with the types of links and threading. Five duplicate executions of an identical test are a waste.\r\n\r\n`Xunit.Theory` is a better mechanism for running a given test with different behavior flags.\r\n\r\nThis issue was found while working on #5881\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n_No response_",
