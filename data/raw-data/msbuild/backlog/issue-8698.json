  "title": "[Bug]: Long versions of intrinsic functions are unreachable",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nOur arithmetic operations treat everything as a double, which means the 'long' version of our intrinsic functions are unavailable. This can induce floating point arithmetic errors, especially at large values where doubles are less precise. We should try to use long and only fall back to double if the input cannot be parsed as a long.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a simple console app and add this target:\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n  <Target Name=\"BadSubtract\">\r\n    <Message Text=\"$([MSBuild]::Subtract(9223372036854775807, 9223372036854775806)) should be 1\" Importance=\"High\" />\r\n  </Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen make that target run.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOutputs `1 should be 1`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOutputs `0 should be 1`\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
