  "body": "### Summary\n\nCheck cases and write a suggestion to escape when there is a `*` or `?` symbol  in an item `<MyItem Include=\"mystaryitemstring/*\">` when the file matching logic matches nothing or returns it as a string.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-special-characters some characters are special in some contexts and it'd be desirable to check when their interpretation runs into edge cases to encourage developers to escape correctly.\n\n### Sample issue or antipattern that the check should be flagging\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10715\n\n\n### Sample output\n\n\"Item on line X, `<MyItem Include=\"aaa*\">` was interpreted as a file glob that matched nothing, if you meant it to be a string, escape special characters according to https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-special-characters?view=vs-2022\"",
