I would proactively disable these tests in this scenario, but I'm not familiar with the background (or reason) for these encoding tests :)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nGo to: `Control panel > Region > Administrative > Change system locale` and enable `Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support`\r\n\r\nRun mentioned tests\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTests should pass\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nTests are failing",
