  "body": "Moved from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues/937 on behalf of @onovotny:\r\n\r\n> A UWP project isn't getting the correct output of a cross-compiled project. Instead it's getting the win8 version.\r\n>\r\n>Check out\r\n>https://github.com/onovotny/Zeroconf/tree/847ef218c7f94a1dc0b0dfa35a4c11d954c97f98\r\n>\r\n>The ZeroconfTest.UWP project has a P2P ref to Zeroconf. Zeroconf has lots of targets. The product in the dll shows what TFM it was built for. When looking at what's in the UWP\\bin\\x86\\Debug directory, I see the win8 version not the uap10.0 version and things break.\r\n>\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system/issues/937#issuecomment-266874274 for the patch that fixed the issue. The problem is that it is $(NugetTargetMoniker) and not $(TargetFrameworkMoniker) that will result in nuget picking the correct \"best\" target for UAP.",
