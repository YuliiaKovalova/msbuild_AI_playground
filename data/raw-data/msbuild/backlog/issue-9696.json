  "body": "_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Mapping-of-missing-targets-files-with-V/1649929)._\n\n---\nWhen trying to build something using msbuild, and you get an error message saying the *.targets file could not be found, it would be super helpful if the error message could also contain the information about which workload (component ID) that need to be installed in order to be able to get the .targets file in place (i.e. to be able to build the target).\n\nThe current behavior is far from optimal, since the .targets file name is not mapping 1:1 to a component ID and there is no public list of what component ID installs what .targets file, so you're basically forced to do trial and error, installing every likely candidate component ID (one at a time, check if the .targets file was installed and if it wasn't,  remove the candidate again and move on to trying the next one).\n\nMaybe I have missed some really basic thing here that could help me out with this? Please note that this is a matter of managing a whole set of build machines, not using the Visual Studio IDE, so using the IDE is not the answer, and not an option here. And I'm also aiming at having an as slim installation of VS as possible, meaning - I don't want to install a lot of unnecessary workloads just because I don't know which one installs which .targets file. A proper solution to this would be great :)\n\nThank you for your understanding and help!\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/29/2022, 08:36 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)",
