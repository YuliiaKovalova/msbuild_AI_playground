  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nAfter updating an existing codebase (multi-targeting .NET 6 and 8) that compiles without warnings, new warnings appear when building with .NET 9 RC2. The new warnings don't make sense to me.\n\nSee the thread at https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13855#issuecomment-2415207763 for details.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Clone https://github.com/json-api-dotnet/JsonApiDotNetCore\n2. Run dotnet build\n\nThe above produces no compile warnings when .NET 6 and 8 are installed. Updating to .NET 9 RC2 shows MSB3277 three times.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo compile warnings.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nwarning MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions...\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
