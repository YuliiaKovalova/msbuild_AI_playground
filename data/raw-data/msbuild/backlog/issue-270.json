  "body": "It looks like the CoreFX version of System.XML is a bit more aggressive about what constitutes a Text node in XML.  The very large strings of whitespace embedded in files in these tests in `src\\XMakeBuildEngine\\UnitTests\\Construction\\ElementLocation_Tests.cs` show up as unexpected Text nodes, causing the `InvalidProjectException` to be thrown while pointing to a different location.\n\nThis may be a CoreFX problem, but for now I'll just disable the tests.\n",
