Feel free to open it up as a WIP PR to get more feedback.\r\n\r\nMy take on it:\r\n- not sure whether to allow task executions, or to restrict it to only what's allowed in the choose elements outside of targets.\r\n- add more tests. To find the relevant tests to duplicate (or transform them into `[Theory]`) you can search for `<choose` in all the `*_Tests.cs` files. But do send the WIP PR before you do this.",
