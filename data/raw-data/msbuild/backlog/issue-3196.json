  "body": "See https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/1730.  Normally `GetFrameworkPaths` will run before `GetReferenceAssemblyPaths`, but if you have a target that runs early and only depends on the latter, then `GetFrameworkPaths` may not run and you will get an error such as:\r\n\r\n> C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.1-preview-007128\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\build\\Microsoft.NET.ConflictResolution.targets(58,5): error : Framework list file path 'v4.0.30319\\RedistList\\FrameworkList.xml' is not rooted. Only full paths are supported. [D:\\Temp\\repro_pack\\repro_pack.csproj]\r\n\r\nI've submitted a [PR](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/2145) to fix the target dependencies in the SDK, but it would be good for the target dependency to be updated in MSBuild itself.",
