  "title": "[Feature Request]: Expose `SolutionFile._solutionFilter` as a read-only",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nIf I open `slnf` via\r\n\r\n```\r\n            var slnfFile = Microsoft.Build.Construction.SolutionFile.Parse(\r\n                slnfFilePath\r\n                );\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will have no access to `slnf` projects, only to `sln` projects. Looks like, there is no problem to expose it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        private HashSet<string> _solutionFilter;     // The project files to include in loading the solution.\r\n\r\n       ///The project files to include in loading the solution.\r\n       public IReadOnlySet<string> SolitionFilterProjects => _solutionFilter;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this trivial approach will be approved, I hope I will be able to prepare a PR. :)\r\n\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nI need to access what projects is in `slnf` file.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nOpen already existing information to public space.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\nAny design will be better, than nothing. I'm fine to accept any.",
