        "body": "Team triage: this is an unfortunate behavior. We wish the behavior for a `ProjectReference` to a not-in-the-solution project was to inherit the `Configuration` of the project that references it, to avoid this confusion.\r\n\r\nHowever, this could result in confusing behavior of its own: the not-in-solution project could be built multiple times (in parallel) with different configurations.\r\n\r\nSince we currently build only once, adding the possibility of parallel builds (and just changing the configuration of the not-in-solution project) could break users, so we're unwilling to make this change now.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior can be worked around by explicitly specifying the configuration using `SetConfiguration` metadata or by adding the referenced project to the solution.",
