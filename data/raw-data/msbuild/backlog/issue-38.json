The beauty of supporting Travis and AppVeyor is that the user only needs to flip a switch on their accounts, and their fork is automatically building. While my company could use a dedicated CI server, our users are better served by us maintaining .travis.yml and appveyor.yml files, as they can fork and experiment without losing the crucial benefit of CI. Of course, all of our projects are public OSS, so there aren't many downsides. \n",
