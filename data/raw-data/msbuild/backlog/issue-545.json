In other cases it's 13.  \n\nIn particular I'm curious about the following:\n- Why is the GUID of a real project listed here for a shared project?  Is there just one entry for every real project that references the shared project?  \n- What does 4 / 13 represent here?  In cases where a project is listed several times one seems to have 13 while all the other instances have 4.  \n",

        "body": "I'm unfamiliar with it. Looking at `src\\vscommon\\idl\\vsshellprivate121.idl` in our super secret internal VS repo (around line 500), I see some interesting comments\n\n``` C++\n// This is an invisible, Solution-scoped hierarchy that coordinates all shared\n// project files that are registered.\n//\n// The only user visible manifestation of this hierarchy is in the SaveChanges dialog where it appears\n// with the name \"[Shared MSBuild Project Files]\" or something similar. This node will appear\n// in the SaveChanges dialog when there are shared MSBuild files that need to be saved and the \n// files are not managed as having affinity to a particular shared MSBuild file using project.\n```\n\nI don't think MSBuild handles this in any way, so you'll have to ask the VS project system folks about the details. I'm curious, too, if you want to include me on the mail :innocent: \n",
