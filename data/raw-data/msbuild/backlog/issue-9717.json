Limiting exposure to other build kit might reduce the overal burden on team\r\n* Arcade is developed and actively supported by organizationaly closer team (and geographically as well for majority of us) - which makes troubleshooting issues less complicated for more junior members of the team.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as mentioned - just a weak opinion based on lmited experience - I can be very easily wrong. Would you actually disagree with those? And can you flash advantages of MicroBuild (I'm lacking knowledge of that - so such info might help shape my opinion)?",
