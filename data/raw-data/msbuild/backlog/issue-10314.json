  "body": "Blocked by https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9823 (that item will decide the fate and possibly resolve this)\n\n### Context\n\nInitial proposal of `BuildAnalyzerRule` has a `Category` field:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/5fab936eeb1a112eb4fb3e611818d33d70238903/src/Build/BuildCheck/API/BuildAnalyzerRule.cs#L46-L49\n\nHowever it was not yet decided how that will be used and if that should be a freeform text or fixed enum.\n\n### Goals\n* Decide whether we should bring back the `Category` and what would be the usage for the field (e.g. mass-configuration of rules by customer, or improved UX)\n* If decided that it's needed:\n   * Document the usage and expected configuration by custom Checks authors\n   * Reintroduce to code\n\n\n### Possibly related\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9823",
