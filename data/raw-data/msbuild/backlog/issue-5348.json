  "body": "We\u2019ve been working as a team, and community, for five years in the dotnet org on the .NET Core project. Many of the same GitHub handles have remained constant over that time, some are new, and others have come and gone. Thanks to everyone that has contributed! We normally focus on how to improve the product, but we\u2019re turning our focus to improving the open source project. We\u2019ve created a survey to better understand your individual experience of participating and contributing in this project.\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate your feedback so we can work to address shortcomings and missed opportunities. If you don\u2019t supply contact details, then responses will be anonymous.\r\n\r\n[Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZLPVNX9?SourceRepo=microsoft%2Fmsbuild)\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nFor discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36235.",
