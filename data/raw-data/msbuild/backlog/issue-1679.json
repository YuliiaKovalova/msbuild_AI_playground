  "body": "Hey friends, \r\nWith all the great strides\u00a0that are happening with the\u00a0*proj format, wouldn't it\u00a0be neat if you could set property values as attributes on the root project element?\r\n\r\nf.e, before:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n`<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" OutputType=\"Exe\" TargetFramework=\"netcoreapp1.0\"/>`\r\n\r\nThis would only be a short hand and most people would set\u00a0most of their properties the old way, but it would get some of\u00a0those properties you always set out of the way. \r\n\r\nIn my mind this would be for properties only, not Items, so the names would not\u00a0be ambiguous in that sense. They'd then\u00a0be pre processed into regular property groups (if I remember correctly there is a preprosessor step that transforms the sdk property already correct?)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? \r\n",
