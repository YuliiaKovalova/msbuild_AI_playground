  "title": "Discussion: Enabling SourceLink by default",
  "body": "SourceLink is a really useful feature when debugging libraries you acquire via a packaging system. In fact, it's really great even for your own source code if you for example pick your binary bits from a build location other than yours (like maybe in a cached-build system).\r\n\r\nIt'd be really useful if we could enable SourceLink by default such that developers don't forget to opt-in to this experience. I'm usually not one for pushing features by default, but this one is so useful that I think it'd be a great default, just like for example generating PDBs is.\r\n\r\nI can imagine some developers maybe reticent adding urls to their code for whatever reason, but they would be able to turn it off.\r\n\r\nChanging defaults is hard, but this would be a change for the better.",
