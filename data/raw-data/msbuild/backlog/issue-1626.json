  "body": "Repro:\r\nCreate a .NET console app and a .NET core library targetting .net standard. (I also had to change to .NET 4.6.2 and .net standard 1.5) Add reference to library project in .net console app and run the app. This will fail with System.Runtime 4.1 load failure.\r\n\r\nWorkaround:\r\nManually add Netstandard.Library package to console app\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nIf I add a project reference to a .net standard dll project I expect the package dependencies of that project to be picked up by msbuild. Having to pack/deploy a library as a nuget and reference the package is NOT the way to go for project references.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nVS2017RC, 26th Jan\r\n",
