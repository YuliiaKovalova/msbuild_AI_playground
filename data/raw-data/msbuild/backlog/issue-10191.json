  "title": "[Feature Request]: Reduce the wrapping around SDK Resolver messages when only one resolver is actually invoked",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nIn https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/41268 I was able to use the SDK Resolver features to ensure that only the NuGet SDK resolver was used for a restore. In this case we should be able to remove MSBuild wrapping around the 'error list' and only surface the single Resolver's message.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nWe want to remove visual noise around error experiences and make it easier for users to diagnose the core problems.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/003252215533cca375dfc6578d8cb9e029418f37/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/SdkResolution/SdkResolverService.cs#L277-L280 should change the way it logs to not log the wrapper if only one resolver was used.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
