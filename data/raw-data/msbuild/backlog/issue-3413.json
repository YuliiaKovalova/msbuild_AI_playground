  "title": "Nuget package installation continues if Init.ps1 fails",
  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstall a Nuget package that executes an Init.ps1 script during the installation. The script ends with Exception (we use throw, and also tried Exit 1 or Exit -1), but the installation continues.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nWe expected that the installation would fail upon Init.ps1 failure.  Basically we have dependencies on external binaries. If the binaries are not found in the system, installation should fail, as our Nuget is not usable.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInstallation continues if Init.ps1 terminates with error.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.7.179.6572 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n15.7.179.6572\r\n\r\nOS info:\r\nWindows 10\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\nVisual Studio Community 2017 Version 15.7.3",
