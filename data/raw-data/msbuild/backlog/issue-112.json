  "body": "It would be great to have a way, how to get full closure of all project references (recursively) from a project. We need this to get information about NuGet packages those referenced projects use. At first we tried to use `BuiltProjectOutputGroupDependencies` metadata, but unfortunately metadata contains only name of last project in dependency chain.\n\nPlease, could you add a target, that would return a full list of referenced projects (recursively)? Or add a name of the project that produced a file to `*OutputGroup` and `*OutputGroupDependencies` metadata, but ensure that it does not get overwritten by subsequent projects.\n\nThanks.\n",
