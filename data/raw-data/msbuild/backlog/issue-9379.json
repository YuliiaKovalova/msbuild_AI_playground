There as well might be possibility to further leverage MSBuild Server (though there is a overlap with current VS build caching techniques). The value and trade-off might not be fully clear\n\n### Goal\n\n* Collect feedback from stakeholders (PM/EM), suggest the path forward (if any) and secure stakeholders buy-in for those\n* If needed actions are identified - start properly tracking and prioritizing those\n\n## Blockers\n\n- [x] https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12540\n- [x] https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10231",
