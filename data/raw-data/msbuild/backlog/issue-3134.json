  "body": "When loading an imported file, MSBuild has a heuristic to determine if the file can be loaded in a faster, more compact fashion:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/d83a9eda20970d2bfa3ad96d47cbecf93343256b/src/Build/ElementLocation/XmlDocumentWithLocation.cs#L378-L400\r\n\r\nThis was designed during The Old Times; target files come from many other places now that might be reasonably assumed to be read-only. But it's not _necessarily_ true that things that come from NuGet packages are immutable, so I'm not entirely sure how to manage the risk of this.\r\n\r\n(noticed when reviewing #3115)",
