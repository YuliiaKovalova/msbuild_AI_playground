  "title": "[Built-in analyzer] The same file is written by multiple tasks during the build",
  "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks one of the BuildCheck analyzers we would like to ship in-box with MSBuild.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nImplement an analyzer with the following rule: Each file written to disk during the build should be written only once. Also known as \"double writes\" analysis.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nWriting the same file multiple times often leads to file access issues and non-deterministic builds. This analyzer will report the violation if it happens within one project as well as between multiple projects. It can be implemented by checking the parameters of well-known tasks like `Copy` and `Csc` (see the [implementation in binlog viewer](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog/blob/main/src/StructuredLogger/Analyzers/DoubleWritesAnalyzer.cs)). Alternatively, it can be implemented based on target outputs, as used by the engine for up-to-date checks.",
