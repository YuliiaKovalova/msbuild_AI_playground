        "body": "Does MSBuild build your projects in parallel from the command line? I'm wondering if, within VS, some internal code reevaluates whether two projects can be built in parallel.\r\n\r\nI don't know the answer to your question, but if it doesn't build them in parallel, you can try building them in parallel from the command line with an attached debugger. It looks like MSBuild only cares about BuildInParallel via the MSBuild task, so you can break in there and see if it decides at some point that it can't use BuildInParallel or if it's just failing for some reason.",
