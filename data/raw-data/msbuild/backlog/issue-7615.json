  "body": "I'm trying to build a Xamarin iOS project on a new computer with a fresh install of Visual Studio for Mac and MSBuild is treating warnings as errors, even though the setting to treat them as errors is turned off.\r\nAlso I tried properties like: `TreatWarningsAsErrors` and `WarningsNotAsErrors` but they don't have any effect.\r\nWhen I move `WarningLevel` from `4` to `0` I'm able to build again.\r\n\r\n~~The same code works on my older MacBook with the same msbuild version without problems. It shows warnings as warnings and not as errors.~~ \r\n\r\nApparently the build also stopped working on my other computer, probably after the latest version update: Warning CS0618 for obsolete class members gets treated as an error.\r\n\r\nIs there some global setting somewhere outside of the project? Either in the solution or global settings that turns warnings into errors?\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.1 for Mono\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

You can set warning-as-error behavior using `Directory.Build.props` or `Directory.Build.targets` files in addition to the individual projects, but that is not new and shouldn't have changed.",
