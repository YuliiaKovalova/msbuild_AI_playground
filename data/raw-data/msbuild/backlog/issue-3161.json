  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun `msbuild` (or more likely `dotnet build` or `dotnet msbuild` inside an `<Exec>`  task in a project, or run unit tests that exec msbuild inside a build, or run two multiproc builds concurrently.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nMSBuild does not connect to nodes that are busy doing a build, and doesn't hang.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nMSBuild can hang when attempting to connect to an MSBuild process that is busy doing another build. In a multiple-builds situation, this can make a subsequent build wait for the results of a previously-started one, even though they share no data. In the nested-msbuild situation, it can mean an infinite hang while trying to talk to nodes above it in the process tree.",
