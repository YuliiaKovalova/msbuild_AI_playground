That's not our package--we haven't published an official NuGet package for our full-Framework assemblies.\n\nPlease reference MSBuild from its installed location (or the GAC). That should also reduce confusion at runtime, because the open-source MSBuild version is 14.1 instead of 14.0 like the official version.\n\nI'll look into getting that package de-listed from NuGet to avoid this confusion in the future.\n",
