  "body": "1. I downloaded the latest preview of dot net core 3.0 (Preview 4, https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) and enabled via \"Use previews of .NET Core SDK\" in VS2019 (Professional edition). I realize this is a preview build, so I'm not expecting a graceful experience \ud83d\udc83 \r\n2. I then got the latest version of https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/windowsforms/matching-game\r\n3. I then attempt to build the project and receive the following error: NETSDK1073: The FrameworkReference 'Microsoft.DesktopUI' was not recognized\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure what's amiss. So I did some digging through my msbuild logs, set to diagnostic. But it doesn't reveal anything to my unfamiliar eyes. Since this is a microsoft sample project, I figured I should report I could not easily get it to compile here. I'm guessing this is the right place, since I don't think there should be anything wrong with the sample project itself.\r\n\r\n[msbuildlog.log](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/3142446/msbuildlog.log)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried a couple other projects in .NET Core 3.0 that utilize windows forms and also experience this error there, too, so I suspect something's up.\r\n",
