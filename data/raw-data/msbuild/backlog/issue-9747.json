  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n#9627\r\n\r\nSingle build has multiple evaluation phases and extra execution phase to facilitate Restore. Running analyzers during those would be superflous - unnecessary perf burden, plus producing duplicite reports.\r\nThere might be cases where analysis during Restore is acutaly wanted - but let's skip such cases for now.\r\n\r\nLet's *somehow* detect that current evaluation/execution is for Restore and defunct analyzers infra during that (or alternatively - let's detect it's for Build and enable only during that).\r\nThe detection will probably be needed in 2 places - first in the connector logger (for the analyzers getting data from BuildEventArgs) and in RequestBuilder - for analyzers getting data directly in the evaluating/executing node (this second place is not yet mounted in current analyzers prototype code - so can be skipped now).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/3809076/9d7f287a-0cdf-4d27-a6b9-97d318900cc4)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Work in this context:\r\n * [ ] https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10172\r\n * [x] https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10145\r\n * [ ] https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10018\r\n",
