  "body": "hi @rainersigwald  following information will be helpful for you, please ping me anytime if you need further clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **- What kind of project(s) do you have?  :**  \r\nI will tell here all the background information with all the tools we using. We having a private repository in GIT calls \"TownSuite/WebPortals\" it is a Web Site based on ASP.NET framework and mainly _C#,Java Script_ languages .  We have several Multiple  _c# projects_ and I will explain you the exact build process later.\r\n\r\n The GIT source code build, Test & deployment process we initiated by using our Jenkins CI server.    So we have Jenkins master server connecting with Jenkins windows slave node.  So Jenikins downloading \"TownSuite/WebPortals\" Source-Code on to that windows Slave node when start the Build process via Jenkins.   Inside that Jenkins windows slave node we have installed Docker Desktop for the purpose of run Windows docker containers on top of that Windows slave node.  So that downloaded Source-code we can mount inside the docker container.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **- Which Docker image are you using?  :**  \r\nWe using a Windows based Docker image.  Actually we having _powershell_ scripts **_(buildrelease-ng-docker.ps1 & buildrelease-ng.ps1)_** running within our Jenkins file for build and test our WebProjects.  So first we run buildrelease-ng-docker.ps1 as below for run the docker container.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44959238/70196007-537eaf80-172d-11ea-8fd8-22398088b7dc.png)\r\nHere I highlighted in yellow the docker build image. \r\n\r\n\r\n### **- How are you building it in the Docker container?** \r\nSo as you can see in above image first we running the docker image and we running out build script _**\".\\buildrelease-ng.ps1\"**_ at the same time inside the docker container.  So all our build tool (MSBuild) and Build command we specifiy inside that buildrelease-ng.ps1 script.  I will show an image of inside the buildrelease-ng.ps1 script as below.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44959238/70196536-fe439d80-172e-11ea-9563-1a5728fdad7c.png)\r\nSo here I Highlighted only a one of the build commands for build one Web.Sln project.  Here MSBuild tool we already have  installed inside the docker container in following path. $MSBUILD=\"C:\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### **- What is the exact error you're seeing, including the file that is locked?**\r\n\r\nBelow is the exact I'm getting on my Jenkins Log Output when Building inside docker container by using the MSBuild tool. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44959238/70196730-b2ddbf00-172f-11ea-8cec-5f677bc9fb16.png)\r\n\r\nThis is only one error these kins of errors happening several times on the log when copying several different dll files. \r\n\r\n\r\n### **- If possible, please include binary logs ?**\r\n\r\nI don't know how to get binary logs.  Is it  the logs for MsBuild ?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @AmilaDevops in https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/4743#issuecomment-561920651_",

        "body": "Thanks for the details, @amiladevops. It's very interesting that the process `System` is what's locking the files. I don't know exactly how Windows containers work; in Linux containers PID 1 is the entry-point process which may not be `init`; if that's the case here it might be misreporting PID 4 as `System` instead of . . . the PowerShell host? Or some other process?\r\n\r\nDoes your failure happen in the first call to MSBuild within the script, or a subsequent one? Always the same place?\r\n\r\nDoes your build create any task assemblies? If so, are they used within the same MSBuild invocation, in a subsequent one, or both?\r\n\r\nCan you change your build script to log all processes with PIDs and command lines before the failing MSBuild invocation? That could help identify PID 4 more clearly.\r\n\r\n> I don't know how to get binary logs. Is it the logs for MsBuild ?\r\n\r\nhttps://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog has instructions (and warnings about what is in the logs--make sure you're willing to share them).",

        "body": "No actually there were different dll files when copying gives this error such as once the WebDbMigrations.dll and once the Townsuite.Web.Poco.dll (like in above screen-shot) sometimes another dll file.\r\n\r\nYes that happenes when the first call to MSBuild within the buildrelease-ng.ps1 script.  Such as when calling MSBuild in below highlighted when our first building project name is \"Web.sln\" , \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44959238/70291923-a1b1b280-1802-11ea-9466-f52ab677067b.png)\r\n\r\nWhen building that project \"Web.sln\" its normally building several dll files such as WebDbMigrations.dll and Townsuite.Web.Poco.dll.  So after build those dll files and when using again those dll files for copy or something (for another purpose) its generating this `System` error always.\r\n\r\nGive me few hours @rainersigwald  I will provide binary log files with more answers for your questions in detal. Thanks.",

If I try to delete these files from the docker host, it says that `wmwp.exe` (Hyper-V) is using the file. I've added my mounted directory to the exclusion list of Defender and the hyper-v processes too but it didn't work. Turning off Real-Time protection didn't change anything so I'm not sure if Defender is the real culprit here. Any idea?\r\n\r\nEdit: I should also note that my Windows Container image is based on the 2019 LTSC image. The image was built a few months ago and worked fine until recently.",
