  "body": "With PR #632, we are swapping out MSBuild's implementation of Path.GetFullPath with the one in .net.\n\nMore tests are needed that cause Path.GetFullPath to throw an exception on Linux and OSX, when the method is called from an item function. The current tests for this scenario are windows only:  https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/632#discussion-diff-63887791R886. Since Unix paths accept everything but `/` and `/0`, it might be tricky to make it fail. Maybe take away file permissions?\n",
