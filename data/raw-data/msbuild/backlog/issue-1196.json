  "body": "MSBuild silently ignores when global properties overwrite local ones: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/286b4d3ef59e9ab21992bba8815b50d025981eb8/src/XMakeBuildEngine/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L1540-L1546\n\nThis can be very confusing and lead to a lot of wasted time trying to figure out what happens and why property elements get seemingly ignored.\nFor a better developer experience, to help debugging, MSBuild could maybe issue a warning?\n\nThere is also an escape hatch which the warning could reference: the `Project` element supports a `TreatAsLocalProperty` attribute that contains property names that can be overridden if they're global: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bcxfsh87.aspx\n",
