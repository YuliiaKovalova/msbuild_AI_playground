  "body": "**Issue**\r\nIf a customer created a net 5 app or got one from a coworker, opens it in 16.7, we have a bad error experience today as we decide it must be a framework application.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/5311\r\n \r\nWe don\u2019t recognize the TFM so we assume it\u2019s a .net framework version and the message matches that.\r\n \r\n**Proposal**\r\nUpdate MSBuild 16.7 with a new message in this specific scenario in the below code path.\r\n \r\n@RainerSigwald, any concerns just adding a check here for if the version is >= to 5.0 and providing a different error?  That seems like the narrowest way to solve this with the least risk. I wouldn\u2019t bother with 16.4.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/29665241066669d6c59f931faabf94a555bcce85/src/Tasks/GetReferenceAssemblyPaths.cs#L249 \r\n \r\n**Other questions**\r\n- How does 16.7 MSBuild parse TFMs with a platform provided (ie net5.0-windows) and will the value for version above be accurate?\r\n- Check precompiled apps\r\n\r\n",
