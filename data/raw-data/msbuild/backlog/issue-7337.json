  "body": "We are developing a UWP app for ARM64 and x64 platforms.\r\nWhen we create the multi-platform package from the Visual Studio wizard it builds only the necessary projects for the target.\r\n\r\n**The problem is when we execute it with msbuild.exe on our CI machines (or locally) it only limits the build to the target for the first platform it builds, and not for any consequent platforms.** This costs us a lot of time, while we wait for the whole solution to build, when we only needed a single project and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at the build log I found `GetSolutionConfigurationContents` target appearing, which looked odd.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60542138/151150195-e730aacf-b24c-451b-815b-f74060aa855c.png)\r\n\r\n**Created a minimal repro for this problem**: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmtpQxAm1CzgggSWIRyyOcMeneDU?e=sQWx9M\r\n1. Build it from VS, so nuget packages are downloaded properly.\r\n2. run `build.ps1` (it expects VS2019)\r\n3. It builds the faulty project as well even though we specified `/t:App`\r\n\r\nif you package it from VS wizard it builds properly.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround we created a separate `.sln` file, that only contains the necessary projects, but needs extra maintenance, so not a solution that we want to keep forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
