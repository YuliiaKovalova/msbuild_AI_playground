  "body": "`PropertyFunctionMSBuildDivide` test uses \"6.5536\" string to represent an expected value. I have Czech regional settings and we are using comma as the decimal symbol, so this test is failing. Local fix is easy - represent the value as number and invoke `ToString()`. Or we can make the `TestPropertyFunction` method generic and call `ToString()` on generic `expected` parameter. ",
