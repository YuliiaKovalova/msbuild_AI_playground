  "body": "#4379 enables projects to skip isolation constraints on certain references. These references should not appear in the serialized caches when `-outputResultsCache` is used. If the projects appear in the serialized caches, it can introduce a side channel through undeclared dependencies leak, leading to harder to understand, unstable builds.",

This had a high number of weird side effects, fixed in PR https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/5222. But the fixes were quite complicated, and after review with @rainersigwald we decided to explore another path, which is to not allow isolation exempt references to be stored in output results file caches, period. But that has consequences of its own which need to be explored.",
