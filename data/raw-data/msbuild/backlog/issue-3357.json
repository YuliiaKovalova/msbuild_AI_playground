  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAll using the new SDK format project:\r\nCreate a root folder, and a `lib` folder inside it.\r\nCreate an entry project (net471) in the root folder. \r\nInside lib folder, use a `Directory.Build.props` to config project inside it to **single** framework `netstandard2.0`.\r\nCreate a library project in lib folder, and contain explicit `<TargetFrameworks>net461;netcoreapp2.0</TargetFrameworks>` to override it to **multiple** frameworks.\r\nReference the library from the entry.\r\nCreate a solution containing them, and build in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nThe library will be built and referenced for target framework `net461`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe library is built for `net461` and `netcoreapp2.0`.\r\nThe entry is requiring `netstandard2.0` one, and cannot find the dll.\r\nIf the library project overrides target framework to single, the project reference can pick the right changed framework.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n15.7.179.6572\r\n\r\nOS info:\r\nWindows 10 Pro 17134\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\nVisual Studio 15.7.2",
