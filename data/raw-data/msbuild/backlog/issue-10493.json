  "body": "MuxLogger and normal logger have output difference of a blank line with the introduction of new event. The [Mux Logger test](https://github.com/maridematte/msbuild/blob/9fa9d800dabce3bfcf8365f651f3a713e01f8a85/src/Utilities.UnitTests/MuxLogger_Tests.cs#L129) was made more lenient so we could get work done without this being a blocker. This issue is being created to keep track of this difference and address it in the future.\n\n## Context\nWhen adding the new event `BuildSubmissionStartedEventArgs` (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10424) an unintentional side effect was changing how the logging output looks like. This is happening because there is a difference in event order between loggers. \n\nUsing the case of the `MockLogger`. The `MockLogger` will receive a `BuildStartedEvent`, log it, and then receive `BuildSubmissionStartedEvent`, log it, and then receive `ProjectStartedEvent` and log it.\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\nBS[BuildStartedEvent] --> BSS[BuildSubmissionStartedEvent] --> BS2[ProjectStartedEvent]\n```\n\nThe MuxLogger will receive a `BuildStartedEvent`, ignore it, receive a `BuildSubmissionStartedEvent`, log it, and then receive `ProjectStartedEvent` when it will create an artificial `BuildStartedEvent` that will then log before logging `ProjectStartedEvent`. \n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\nBS[BuildSubmissionStartedEvent] --> BSS[BuildStartedEvent] --> BS2[ProjectStartedEvent]\n```\n\nThis causes the general event order to be different and for the outputs to be different.",

        "body": "This different order might result in VS loggers either getting data in different order or not getting events before `BuildStartedEvent`, which is currently only `BuildSubmissionStartedEvent` needed for analyzers. This is acceptable until we bring analyzers to VS scenarios (checked with exp VS insertion). At this point, another aspect will surface - how to set up the analyzers along or using the `MuxLogger`. We will need to figure out ordering issues at that time. ",
