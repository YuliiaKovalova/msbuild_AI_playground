In OmniSharp, we end up calling `TryFromSetupApi` via [reflection](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/blob/ba90f476d80f333c052f59627444cc157416d169/src/OmniSharp.MSBuild/MSBuildHelpers.cs#L65-L78) in order to determine whether we should set environment variables to use MSBuild in Standalone mode. In VS Code, we only want to be standalone as a last resort.",
