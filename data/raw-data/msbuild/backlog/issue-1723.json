  "body": "Hey,\r\n\r\nI tried to make a simple c++ clr console project(A) and make a reference on a native dll project(B).\r\nI set the output path to another folder in Visual Studio. Instead of \r\n$(SolutionDir) ...\r\ntool\r\n$(ProjectDir) ...\r\n\r\nThe Project B Dll is not getting copied to the output path. \r\nhttps://github.com/JackGrinningCat/TestReferenceNativeDLL\r\n\r\nIt is documented that the private tag stands for the \"CopyLocal\" and the definition on the visual studio description points out, that it is copying the output from the references project to the output path of the referencing project.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be around for long but actually i don't understand why there is no solution besides \"Add an xcopy command in the post build task\"? Can somebody help me to understand the issue. Maybe I have to set something specific.\r\n",
