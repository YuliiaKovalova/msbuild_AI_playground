  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nI've attached a solution+project that repros the bug pretty easily: [Repro.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/files/4301234/Repro.zip)\r\n\r\nWithin the zip archive and adjacent to the .sln file are two batch scripts: \r\n#### build_without_var.bat\r\nUnset variable MSBuildEmitSolution by setting it equal to nothing and then invoke \"msbuild Repro.sln /restore\" on the solution directory.\r\n\r\n#### build_with_var_set_0.bat\r\nSet variable MSBuildEmitSolution equal to 0 and then invoke \"msbuild Repro.sln /restore\" on the solution directory. \r\n\r\n_Note that both scripts use the default 2019 BuildTools path for msbuild, you may need to change the path to whatever it would be on your own machine._\r\n\r\nFirst execute **build_without_var.bat** and then note the contents of the solution directory. Then execute **build_with_var_set_0.bat** and look again at the contents of the solution directory.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nBoth scripts should be functionally equivalent, no metaproj files are persisted to disk.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n**build_with_var_set_0.bat** will cause metaproj files to be persisted to disk despite MSBuildEmitSolution having a value of 0\r\n\r\nI'm not at all familiar with the source code and could be way off, but [this](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Shared/Traits.cs#L75) stood out to me as a potential source of the bug. The field is set to true if the value of MSBuildEmitSolution is any non-empty string rather than just the string \"1\" (as seems to be the case [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Shared/Traits.cs#L62)).\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.4.0+e901037fe for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n16.4.0.56107\r\n```\r\nOS info:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft Windows 10 Enterprise\r\n10.0.17763 Build 17763\r\n```\r\n~~If applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):~~\r\n",
