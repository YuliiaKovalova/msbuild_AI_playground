  "body": "When running build with parameter /p:AppxBundlePlatforms=\"x86|x64\" it doesn't produce x86 build symbols (appxsym). Well, really it produces but as build script calls _DeleteAppxOutputFolderIfNecessary they are removed right before building x64 version.\r\nHere's repository to reproduce the issue: https://github.com/GDreyV/uwp-msbuild-test (it's just default empty uwp app)\r\nArguments used to build the app: https://github.com/GDreyV/uwp-msbuild-test/blob/master/build.cmd\r\nBuild logs: https://github.com/GDreyV/uwp-msbuild-test/blob/master/build-log.txt \r\nHere x86 symbols were produced: https://github.com/GDreyV/uwp-msbuild-test/blob/master/build-log.txt#L496\r\nand here folder was cleaned up: https://github.com/GDreyV/uwp-msbuild-test/blob/master/build-log.txt#L989",
