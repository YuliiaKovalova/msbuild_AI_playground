  "title": "[Bug]: SDK style Net48 projects do not support transitive dependencies.",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWe are trying to convert a project with a legacy project file, with .Net framework 4.8 as target, to an SDK style project. I used the .Net upgrade assistent (command line) tool for this.\r\n\r\nHowever (among several other problems) we ran into the issue that certain transitive dependencies are not working anymore. After some trial and error I could reproduce it in a new simple Visual Studio solution. And it became clear that it is the combination of .Net framework 4.8 in an sdk style project that is not supporting transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI set up a solution where project a directly depends on project b, which in turn directly depends on project c, and where project a references something in project c. And test it with some different configurations. I tested the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject a             => project b            => project c\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 Legacy         => Net48 Legacy\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => Net48 SDK\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => Net48 Legacy\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => netstandard2.0 SDK\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => netstandard2.0 SDK   => netstandard2.0 SDK\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => netstandard2.0 SDK   => Net48 Legacy\r\n```\r\n\r\n[testSDKTransitives.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/11041090/testSDKTransitives.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject a             => project b            => project c             || build successful\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 Legacy         => Net48 Legacy          || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => Net48 SDK             || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => Net48 Legacy          || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => netstandard2.0 SDK    || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => netstandard2.0 SDK   => netstandard2.0 SDK    || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => netstandard2.0 SDK   => Net48 Legacy          || Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nproject a             => project b            => project c             || build successful\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 Legacy         => Net48 Legacy          || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => Net48 SDK             || No\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => Net48 Legacy          || No\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => Net48 SDK            => netstandard2.0 SDK    || No\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => netstandard2.0 SDK   => netstandard2.0 SDK    || Yes\r\nnetstandard2.0 SDK    => netstandard2.0 SDK   => Net48 Legacy          || Yes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nProjects targeting .Net framework 4.8 and using the new SDK style projects do not pass on their transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 17.1.0+ae57d105c for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n17.1.0.7609\r\n\r\nTool invoking the build in reproduction is Visual Studio 2022 17.1.0\r\nTool invoking the build in our real life situation is msbuild with version as shown above I think.\r\n\r\nedit: fixed some outlining\r\nedit2: changed .Net assistant to .Net upgrade assistant",
