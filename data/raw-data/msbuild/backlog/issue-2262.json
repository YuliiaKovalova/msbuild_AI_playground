  "title": "MsBuild seem to derive assembly bitness from setup project",
  "body": "When building WiX project (which is x86), dependencies are getting built as x86 despite the fact they are specify platform as AnyCPU. This is wrong - bitness of setup project has nothing to do with assemblies it packages.\r\n\r\nAlso, in another case, there may be 32-bit executable using IL-only .NET Core and Any CPU executable using same binaries. If common binary is built as dependency of x86 executable, it fails to load on 64-bit machine for IL Only exe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a way to turn off derivation of platform? I need assemblies built exactly as specified in their projects, not by platform of an executable (or setup) that depend on them.",
