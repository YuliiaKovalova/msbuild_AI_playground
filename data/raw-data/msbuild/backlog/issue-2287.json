  "body": "Turns out Directory.GetFiles/GetDirectories isn't very efficient, it allocates [two strings](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/io/filesystemenumerable.cs,512) for every file even though only 1 is used by Dictionary,GetFiles.\r\n\r\nThat extra string allocation is causing 2.7% of all allocations opening a project. In this example below (ProjectSystem.sln) that's 90 MB of extra data that is never used or looked at.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1103906/28123362-28a9ba5a-6764-11e7-9c66-5f5a735fc648.png)\r\n\r\nLooks like .NET Core has rewritten this path, unsure whether this will be ported to .NET Framework though. Do we push .NET to fix this? Or rewrite this to be a little less allocation heavy?\r\n\r\n",
