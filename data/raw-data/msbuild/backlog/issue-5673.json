  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nI found that if solution file is for Visual Studio 2010 with project which include use of \"SQL Server Data Tools\" (SSDT). We get error MSB4019 to path \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Professional\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\r\n\\SqlServer.targets\" if we use current msbuild version by command: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Professional\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\msbuild\" /t:Clean Test.sln\r\n\r\nIn this case the project file with SSDT is also ToolsVersion 4.0. Only resave solution, which changes from csproj to sqlproj in solution file fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n* extract the append test.zip and execute the \"clean.bat\" to show error MSB4019\r\n* open with VS2019 (need SSDT installed) press reload of the include project (seems incompatible), this changes only the solution file, press save and now the \"clean.bat\" will work\r\n\r\n[test.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/5117806/test.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nclean without error\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nMSB4019\r\n### Analysis\r\nUpdate solution would fix it, in case this is a wont fix this could help others to understand the issue.\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nMsbuild 16.7.0+b89cb5fde\r\nI tested it now also with 16.8.0-dev-20425-01+79ab985eb, same behavior.",
