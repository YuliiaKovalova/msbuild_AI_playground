  "title": "Add analyzer support for the new Tasks",
  "body": "We should do some investment to make authoring the new Tasks easier for users:\n* BannedAPI Analyzer to prevent the usage of harmful APIs like System.Environment, System.File, etc.\n  * Based on [docs](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/69728a35a4414e1d1b12dfcecccf178a34e99561/src/RoslynAnalyzers/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers/BannedApiAnalyzers.Help.md), all we should have to do is add a file like `BannedSymbols.MSBuildMultiThreadedTask.txt` as part of the `AdditionalFiles` of a project and the BannedApiAnalyzer should take it from there. We should\n    * author such a file\n    * include it in our MSBuild Package that includes the Task abstractions today\n    * include build logic to include this file as an `AdditionalFiles` item when `BannedSymbolsOptOut` isn't `true`\n    * help ensure that the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers` package is _also_ referenced by the user's project.",
