  "body": "MSB4064 is fired when a task has been successfully loaded but is missing a field that the XML invocation of the task defined. This often arises due to versioning problems: a task is revised to add a parameter, the target that invokes it is changed to pass it, but at runtime the old version of the task is loaded (see #663 for common reasons why).\r\n\r\nThe error is\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4064: The \"NullableReferenceTypes\" parameter is not supported by the \"Csc\" task. Verify the parameter exists on the task, and it is a settable public instance property.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error could be more actionable if it dumped some more information, like assembly identity of the loaded task, and path on disk it was loaded from. Something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror MSB4064: The \"{propertyName}\" parameter is not supported by the \"{typeName}\" task loaded from {assemblyIdentity} at path {path}. Verify that the UsingTask points to the correct assembly, the parameter exists on the task, and it is a settable public instance property.\r\n```",
