  "title": "Please stop lying about the exit code of an `exec` task",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nWhen the Exec/ToolTask runs a process with exit code 0 but it has logged to stderr, the task's exit code is set to -1:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/695b1ef88c242c19a95c9f6a504a2376661762c2/src/Utilities/ToolTask.cs#L811-L815\n\nIt's documented and fine (at least when you have read it) and this surely makes some sense.\n\n\nBut when this happens a message is logged like:\n\n```cmd\nThe command \"xxxxxxx\" exited with code -1.\n```\n\nAnd this is not OK. It is a blatant lie, **because the command HAS NOT exited with code -1**.\n\nIt has exited with code 0 - and only the task's ExitCode property is set to -1 because some output has been logged to stderr.\n\n\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nTwo painful days totally wasted due to the incorrect log message and I'm pretty sure I'm not the first one.\n\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nThis is not about changing any behavior.\n\nBut please fix the log output to make it clear what has happened instead of printing wrong statements.\n\nThank you\nsw\n",

        "body": "The ToolTask.ExitCode property, and the corresponding task parameter, are documented as returning -1 if the process had 0 as the exit code but the task logged some errors.  If you change the log output not to claim that the exit code is -1 in this case, and that change affects ToolTask.ExitCode too, please update its documentation.
