  "body": "Judging from the build logs, `dotnet build` will start on its own first and recursively compile the project dependencies.\nHowever, `Visual Studio 2022 build` seems to sort out all the dependency relationships first, and finally compile each project only once from the front to the back.\n\ndotnet build log:\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5de3ba9-aad8-48d5-8e83-be1a525bf152\" height=\"450\">\n\nVisual Studio 2022 build log:\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64d58e10-71b8-4fa7-a33e-3ce0228b9687\" height=\"450\">\n\nSo how can we get a clear understanding of these differences?",
