  "body": "I have an unconfirmed hunch that we can speed up some item operations in the `_GetCopyToOutputDirectoryItemsFromTransitiveProjectReferences` target.\r\n\r\nConsider for example this snippet:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/dbf8d12deab2aee74f1bd574c1ecad2b39f552b4/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L5108-L5109\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that this can be collapsed in a single line with the condition Always or PreserveNewest.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is used quite a lot:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/dbf8d12deab2aee74f1bd574c1ecad2b39f552b4/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L5108-L5178\r\n\r\nI'd be curious to measure the performance of a reasonable large build with a lot of project references and copy to output, and see if we can see any difference. You can use this query in the binlog viewer: `$target GetCopyToOutputDirectoryItems $time`",

We might or might not see a difference in the total build duration, and I'd be curious if we see a diff or not. But even if the time for the targets comes down, it'll be a good thing (because we'll be doing less compute and less allocations).",
