With this bug, the when invoking the target name on the solution the target instead runs once per project. When fixed, it runs once per solution file.\r\n\r\nFor example, we ran in to this bug when using a NuGet called 'GenerateRestoreGraphFile'. When invoked on a solution, it is meant to fine all projects and produce one json file per .sln file.\r\n\r\n    msbuild my.sln /t:GenerateRestoreGraphFile /p:RestoreGraphOutputPath=graph.json\r\n\r\nThe problem we ran into -- and had to work around here https://github.com/aspnet/Universe/commit/7f7413b3ebb780b77e20111299b7f7c20cd25ed3 -- was that instead, this was instead producing a json file per project, not per solution.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/1fba68a876c0a23ff99f563438a45945988c817b/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/NuGet.targets#L114 for the implementation of GenerateRestoreGraphFile ",
