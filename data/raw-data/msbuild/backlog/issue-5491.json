  "title": "Using 'var' to deduce type with a string constant causes type to be deduced as a nullable string",
  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nWith `<Nullable>enabled</Nullable>` in the csproj file, use var to deduce the type of a variable assigned with a string constant. By highlighting the type, looking at Intellisense results, or building the project, you can see that the deduced type is of 'string?'.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar str = \"value\"; // str is of type 'string?'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn earlier versions of Visual Studio (Like 16.4.x), the type was deduced as 'string'. This resulted in some discrepancies in behavior and created additional warnings in the code that were not present before.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe deduced type of str would be 'string'\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOn 16.4.3: The type of str is 'string'\r\nOn 16.6.1, 16.6.3: The type of str is 'string?'\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\nUsed Visual Studio 16.6.1 or 16.6.3 to compile on Windows 10 (64bit)\r\n\r\n### Project demonstrating issue\r\n[TestApp.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/files/4886421/TestApp.zip)\r\n",
