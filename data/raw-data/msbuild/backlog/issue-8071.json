We may have fixed this for RC2, but in either case the feature has been disabled for the GA release. For RC1 you can set the environment variable `DOTNET_CLI_DO_NOT_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` to `true` to disable the feature. You can also kill the MSBuild Server processes with `dotnet build-server shutdown` instead of forcibly killing all dotnet processes.",
