Following (or at least trying to use) convention used by majority of dotnet repos like corefx, coreclr etc. will give sheer benefits.\r\n\r\nBasic setup:\r\n\r\nWindows: .\\build.cmd release\r\nUnix: ./build.sh release\r\n\r\nNot sure why Roslyn and MSBuild teams chose the term `cibuild`. No harm in using different names, but there are more advantages in convergence for external contributors, engineering teams..",
