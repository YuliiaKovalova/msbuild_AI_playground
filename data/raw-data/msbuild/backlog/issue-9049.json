  "body": "from @baronfel in chat offline:\r\n\r\n> should we include a count of errors in relevant places? I'm specifically thinking of the individual project build report sections (`\"<projectname> <tfm> failed with errors <time>\"` => `\"<projectname> <tfm> failed with <count> errors <time>\"`) and the final summary `\"Build failed with errors in <time>\"` => `\"Build failed with <total_count> errors in <time>\"`)\r\n> \r\n> I ask because that number is a quick visual check for a repeated-build scenario, and once you get past a certain number of reported errors (a screenful) counting yourself becomes untenable.",
