  "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks one of the BuildCheck analyzers we would like to ship in-box with MSBuild.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nImplement an analyzer with the following rule: `Reference` items are not allowed to reference outputs of projects that are part of the build.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nWhen one project depends on another, the `ProjectReference` item should be used to codify the relationship. It is generally incorrect to use a `Reference` for this purpose.",

We should decide whether those will be flagged or allowed under v1 of this analyzer. I'm pretty ok either way but we should write down the thought process.",
