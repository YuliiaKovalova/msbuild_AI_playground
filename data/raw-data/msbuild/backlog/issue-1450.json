  "body": "Some CLI tests were failing with this error\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Exceptions.InvalidProjectFileException: The imported project \"C:\\Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets\" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause turned out to be that older MSBuild binaries were being used with new MSBuild targets (that use `$(RoslynTargetsPath)` introduced in #1339 to find `Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets`). The older MSBuild didn't define `RoslynTargetsPath`, so it expanded to nothing, causing MSBuild to try to expand `\\Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets`, resolving to the root of the drive.",
