  "body": "I'd like if the `DefaultSdkResolver` would be able to resolve versioned SDK references from inside `MSBuildSdksPath` in addition to versionless references.\r\nSo `FooSdk/1.2.3` could be resolved from `{MSBuildSdksPath}/FooSdk/1.2.3/Sdk`.\r\n\r\nThis would help for integration testing custom SDKs where you could generate a version that won't end up on NuGet and make sure the project used for the test resolves to the version generated for the test.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem reasonable?\r\nIf so, I'd be happy to implement it.",

Right now I don't mind the idea, but I may have forgotten a good reason.\r\n\r\nBiggest reason not to that I can think of is that we don't really want to encourage putting user stuff into MSBuild's installation directory, which is where MSBuildSdksPath lives (by default).",
