        "body": "It looks like the the `<Error />` and `<Warning />` tasks don't log anything if the message is empty.  I think we should log something like \"the message as empty\" and ensure that the XML element location is there so people know where to look for these empty messages.\n\nThis will change existing behavior but I think it's an improvement.  If people want to keep the existing behavior, they can add a condition.\n",

        "body": "@rainersigwald did the build still say failed?  I think if the build fails anyway, it's safe to log an error saying \"(No message specified)\" right?\n\nThe warning thing is a little trickier if people are expecting to use this functionality as a conditional way of not warning.  For instance:\n\n``` xml\n<Target Name=\"MyTarget\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <MyMessage Condition=\" false \">Something has gone horribly wrong</MyMessage>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <Warning Text=\"$(MyMessage)\" />\n</Target>\n```\n\nThis would be an overt way of not warning depending on the condition.  Or if the message came as an output from a task.\n\nBut it's still just a warning...  So fix this by logging something like \"(The message was empty)\" and have an environment variable which people can set to get back the old behavior?\n",
