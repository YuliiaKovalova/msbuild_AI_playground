But the [documentation of the MsBuild.UnloadProjectsOnCompletion property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.build.tasks.msbuild.unloadprojectsoncompletion.aspx) says that that the property isn't used (which seems to be confirmed by the [code](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/XMakeTasks/MSBuild.cs)).\r\n\r\nObviously the work around is to call MsBuild from the Exec task however that seems to defeat the purpose of having the MsBuild task which is supposed to be faster and easier to use (especially when it comes to passing in additional properties).\r\n\r\nAt the very least it would be nice if the documentation was updated to indicate that the property is useless, ideally the MsBuild task code would be updated to use the property and unload the projects once it is done so that we can run the code above.",
