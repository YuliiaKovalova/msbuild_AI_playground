  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nIf `msbuildcheck` template is being instantiated with name (or implicit name derived from the current dir name) that starts with number - the include item fro the 'magic' props is broken\r\n\r\n### Repro steps\r\n\r\n* `dotnet new msbuildcheck -n 123`\r\n* The created csproj will contain broken include (the name `_123.props` doesn't correspond with the filename - `123.props`):\r\n```\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Include=\"_123.props\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"build\\_123.props\" />\r\n    <Content Include=\"README.md\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThis has to do with templating feature that is trying to make the names a valid C# token names - so numbers are auto-prefixed with '_'. We need to make sure that the include link is not expanded like this, or that the props file name is generated that way",
