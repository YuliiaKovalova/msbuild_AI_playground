  "body": "When using CodeTaskFactory, if a Reference element is missing the Include attribute, or a Using element is missing the Namespace attribute, an error is printed about an empty attribute value.\r\n\r\nThis error isn't great for a few reasons\r\n\r\n1. It doesn't say which element the attribute is on\r\n2. It says \"The \"Include\" attribute has been set but is empty\" even when it's *missing*\r\n3. It's emitted at the point the task is _used_, not declared, so the message about the Include attribute is easily confused for referring to the Items passed to the task",

We've had to [disable this](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Tasks/CodeTaskFactory.cs#L1025) `CodeTaskFactory` on .NET Core and instead I'm working on this other `CodeTaskFactory` that will ship with the Roslyn MSBuild task library which will use Roslyn to compile an in-memory assembly.  Hopefully that makes sense.",
