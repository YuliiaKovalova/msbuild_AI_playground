If it is, then it sounds like VS may be inserting spurious white spaces, because:\n- the first child overwrites any initial empty space in the parent, and adds the proper whitespace for the next element (in this case the closing tag of the parent): https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/XMakeBuildEngine/UnitTestsPublicOM/Construction/WhiteSpacePreservation_Tests.cs#L229-L254\n- subsequent children mirror the trailing whitespace of the first child: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/XMakeBuildEngine/Construction/ProjectElementContainer.cs#L489-L498\n\nJust in case though, I'm going to add unit tests for adding children to parents with existing siblings and assert for whitespace. :)\n\nDo you know who owns the bit of code in VS that adds the references?\n",

What would be really helpful here is to learn what MSBuild APIs the bit of VS code that's adding reference items is using. The tests suggest that VS might be adding some spurious new lines, and then msbuild's logic is \"preserving\" them.\n",
