  "body": "Hi here Marco from coverlet https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet\r\n\r\nOne of most requested feature is \"Solution wide coverage\".\r\n\r\nTo do that we need to sync/communicate with concurrent running task https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet/tree/master/src/coverlet.msbuild.tasks\r\n\r\nIs there a build-in mechanism?\r\nIf I run for instance `dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true MergeWith.sln` (https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet/issues/598#issuecomment-551174529) I see overlapping task instances and concurrent tests.\r\nWe should sync `CoverageResultTask ` https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet/blob/master/src/coverlet.msbuild.tasks/CoverageResultTask.cs#L73 and wait all tests and merge results.\r\n\r\nIs there a way/pattern to do this?Or we need to implement custom sync/interprocess communication(we need a unique identifier to group task of same sln build)?\r\n\r\ncc: @tonerdo",

So please consider whether there's any way you can redesign to avoid the need for the synchronization.\r\n\r\nEh...it's also my concern \ud83d\ude1e but users complain about the fact that msbuild works only with \"project\" and there are some tool/fields that need to be grouped to \"solution\" to be useful.\r\nUsers want only 1 coverage report file but we can run task only \"project based\" and also runs in parallel \r\n\r\nThank's for quick response @rainersigwald if you've some link on docs or some project that tackled this problem let me know.",
