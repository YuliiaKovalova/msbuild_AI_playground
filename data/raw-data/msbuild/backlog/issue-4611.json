  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nThere is a long standing issue when CL and Link tasks hang sometimes waiting on a pipe they create to get unicode output from the tools (the problem described here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/pipe-handle-inheritance). \r\nTo avoid this problem, the write handle of the pipe must be closed right after the tool process is created.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way we can do it in a task derived from \r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Utilities/ToolTask.cs \r\n\r\nPlease add an overridable method in ToolTask class and call it in Execute() after process.Start().\r\n\r\n",
