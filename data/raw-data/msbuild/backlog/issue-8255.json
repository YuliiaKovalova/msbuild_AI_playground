  "title": "Update .vsconfig to remove .NET Core 2.1 component",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n.NET Core 2.1 is out of support and is not used in the projects in MSBuild.sln. Removing the \"Microsoft.Net.Core.Component.SDK.2.1\" ID from the .vsconfig file will stop Visual Studio from complaining when .NET Core 2.1 is not installed. This is a minor annoyance but it is also a minor change. See quick edit https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/0221d3a8a8372bc8a099cd5a3475c6906c4ac83a. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Confirm that .NET Core 2.1 is not installed.\r\n2. Open MSBuild.sln or MSBuild.Dev.slnf in Visual Studio.\r\n3. Note the message displayed: \"Based on your solution, you might need to install extra components for a full development experience.\"\r\n4. Build the solution and note that the build succeeds without .NET Core 2.1 installed.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-19 121152](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1728516/208483878-d6a7bccb-2217-41e7-9dc0-af524418b767.png)\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe solution's requirements/dependencies have changed and the .vsconfig file is not up to date.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nIssue observed with VS2022.",
