  "body": "Today, if you want to explicitly pick the `TargetFramework` of a `ProjectReference`, you must specify two metadata values:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\multitargeted_lib\\multitargeted_lib.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=netstandard2.0</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties>true</SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties>\r\n    </ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties` is redundant: if `SetTargetFramework` is set, we can assume that we shouldn't do the negotiation.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/477#issuecomment-247069314 (cc @nguerrera)",

        "body": "It's slightly less specific than `SetTargetFramework`, and harder to detect for a case like this, but otherwise works the same, I think. The side effect of forcing the reference into its inner build and sidestepping the outer-build negotiation is interesting. It might even be better that way, though right now I think I prefer the explicit approach.",
