  "body": "We would like to implement and perform stress tests for the RAR task in order to identify possible issues with concurrency. This issue is part of the RAR as a service user story: #3139.\r\n\r\nSome of the RAR inputs/outputs are rarely used. The goal of this issue is to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] review the automatically-collected data set of inputs and outputs of RAR task from issue #6296 in order to find unused ones.\r\n- [ ] manually add some tests for missed inputs/outputs in order to get full coverage of all the possible inputs and outputs of the RAR task.",
