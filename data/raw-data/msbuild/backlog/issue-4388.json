  "body": "Please add an option to the csproj file that allows me to define only specific warnings to be treated as errors. \r\n\r\nMy use case is that I would like to transform a larger code base to be nullable aware. Unfortunately this code base has a lot of other warnings when the solution is built. Those are uncritical and for now.\r\n\r\nThe solution should not compile as long as there are warning related to nullable types left. \r\n\r\nI suspect that in the months after C# 8 hits the street, a lot code bases will be made nullable aware and a lot of people will be in a similar situation as I am now.",
