In isolated builds this probably means that the references are not explicitly specified as a ProjectReference item in \"{1}\"\r\n\r\nFile Name:\r\nBuild\\Resources\\xlf\\Strings.xlf\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\nQuery:\r\nWould you please check if some part of the instruction is dated? It says \"task\" is also not to be translated, but it seems translatable . Would you please check and advise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0 | Dev={StrBegin=\"MSB4254:\"}DevComment=\\r\\n       LOCALIZATION: Do not localize the following words:  ProjectReference, MSBuild, task.;\r\n-- | --\r\n",

        "body": "@PDostalek In this context `task` specifically means \"MSBuild task\", not a general meaning of the word. But it seems that we generally translate `task` in that context, for instance\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/3453beee039fb6f5ccc54ac783ebeced31fec472/src/Tasks/Resources/xlf/Strings.it.xlf#L1395-L1399\r\n\r\nSo I think you're right, and `task` is translatable here.\r\n\r\ncc @cdmihai ",
