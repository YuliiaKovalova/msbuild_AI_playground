        "body": "@JohnChen0 It looks like our Mono build and our .NET Core build both claim `OSX`. Mono's `xbuild`, on the other hand, does report `Unix` on OS X. It seems like the MSBuild behavior is better, since I don't know how you distinguish between OS X and Linux otherwise.\n\nI would prefer to keep the current MSBuild behavior. Do you feel otherwise?\n",

Is this MSBuild.exe really xbuild instead of MSBuild?\n\nI'm OK with keeping the current MSBuild behavior, and work it around in CoreCLR build. Just want to make sure we're not introducing a compatibility problem that many people will need to work around.\n",

        "body": "AFAIK the current Mono behavior is that way for historical reasons. From http://www.mono-project.com/docs/faq/technical/#how-to-detect-the-execution-platform :\n\n> Notice that as of Mono 2.2 the version returned on MacOS X is still 4 _(== Unix)_ for legacy reasons, too much code was written between the time that the MacOSX value was introduced and the time that we wrote this text which has lead to a lot of user code in the wild to not cope with the newly introduced value.\n\nxbuild just uses `Environment.OSVersion.Platform` that's why it ends up being `Unix` on OSX and Linux.\n\nA lot of code out there seems to rely on this, so this is a breaking change.\n",

        "body": "I talked to @ValMenn and @cdmihai about this today, and it sounds like the packaged Mono version of MSBuild had a bug (since fixed) that caused us to always report `Unix`. I didn't see it because the code that returns the string is unchanged, but methods it calls now work right.\n\nI don't think we have a significant compatibility concern here--if someone is moving from xbuild to MSBuild, I think it's reasonable to ask them to update conditions to the more expressive variety. Good to check though--if you're reading this and disagree, please comment with your reasoning.\n",
