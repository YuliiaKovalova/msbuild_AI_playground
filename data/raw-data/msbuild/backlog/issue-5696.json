I have the `<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>`, because I need the xml documentation files of my own projects for the Swagger OpenAPI documentation. What I don't need is for example the 3MB documentation file from `System.Reactive`.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to exclude the documentation files of referenced packages? Otherwise it might be good to extend the `ExcludeAssets` list with an option for xml documentation files,\r\n\r\n`<PackageReference Include=\"System.Reactive\" Version=\"4.4.1\" ExludeAssets=\"xmldoc\" />`",
