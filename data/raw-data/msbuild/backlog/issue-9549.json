  "title": "[Bug]: Placeholder syntax does not work as expected for extension manifests",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\n**case 1:**\r\nReference to a property, like this `$(PropertyName)`, that's defined in the VSIX project does not work for vsixmanifest.\r\n\r\nDespite what is stated in this [document ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/vsix-extension-schema-2-0-reference?view=vs-2022#placeholder-syntax-for-extension-manifests):\r\n> To reference a property that's defined in the VSIX project, use the same syntax as you would in the project file itself, $(PropertyName).\r\n\r\nBut instead we get the same `$(PropertyName)` in the output without replacement. \r\n\r\n**Case 2:**\r\nI also tried to reference an MSBuild target instead to get the desired behavior:\r\n`<GettingStartedGuide>https://|%CurrentProject%;GetTest|</GettingStartedGuide>`\r\n\r\nHere is the target:\r\n`<Target Name=\"GetTest\" Returns=\"www.somedomen.com/team/platform/doc/page.html\" />`\r\n\r\nIt works, but not in the way we expect. This is what I get on the way out:\r\n`<GettingStartedGuide>https://page.html<GettingStartedGuide>`\r\nOnly the last part of the link is shown, as if it is trying to return the file name instead. \r\nNote: the issue only occurs when there is a 'slash' character in the returned string.\r\n\r\n**Case 3:**\r\nMoreower, if the target returns the full link, including \"https://\", it lieads to an errror.\r\n`<Target Name=\"GetTest\" Returns=\"https://www.somedomen.com/team/platform/doc/page.html\" />`\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n[case1.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/13682794/case1.zip)\r\n[case2.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/13682678/case2.zip)\r\n[case3.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/13682690/case3.zip)\r\n\r\n1) Unzip attached samples and build each solution in debug configuration.\r\n2) Check VSIX file in the output.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nVSIX should be built with the replacement of the placeholder with the correct values.\r\n\r\n**case 1:**\r\nThe description in the output VSIX should be:\r\n`<Description>Test description.</Description>`\r\n\r\n**case 2:**\r\nThe GettingStartedGuide in the output VSIX should be:\r\n`<GettingStartedGuide>https://www.somedomen.com/team/platform/doc/page.html</GettingStartedGuide>`\r\n\r\n**case 3:**\r\nThe GettingStartedGuide in the output VSIX should be:\r\n`<GettingStartedGuide>https://www.somedomen.com/team/platform/doc/page.html</GettingStartedGuide>`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nPlaceholder syntax does not work as expected for extension manifests.\r\n\r\n**case 1:**\r\nThe description in the output VSIX actually is:\r\n`<Description>$(TestProp)</Description>`\r\n\r\n**case 2:**\r\nThe GettingStartedGuide in the output VSIX actually is:\r\n`<GettingStartedGuide>https://page.html</GettingStartedGuide>`\r\n\r\n**case 3:**\r\nVSIX is not being built and failed with an error:\r\n> Error\tMSB4018\tThe \"DetokenizeVsixManifestSource\" task failed unexpectedly.\r\n> System.NotSupportedException: The given path's format is not supported.\r\n>    at System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission.EmulateFileIOPermissionChecks(String fullPath)\r\n>    at System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission.QuickDemand(FileIOPermissionAccess access, String fullPath, Boolean checkForDuplicates, Boolean needFullPath)\r\n>    at System.IO.FileInfo.Init(String fileName, Boolean checkHost)\r\n>    at Microsoft.VisualStudio.Sdk.BuildTasks.DetokenizeVsixManifestSource.Execute()\r\n>    at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskExecutionHost.Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.ITaskExecutionHost.Execute()\r\n>    at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.TaskBuilder.<ExecuteInstantiatedTask>d__26.MoveNext()\tVSIXProject1\tC:\\Users\\nik-i\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.vssdk.buildtools\\17.0.5210-preview5\\tools\\VSSDK\\Microsoft.VsSDK.targets\t133\t\t\n\n### Analysis\n\ncase 1:\r\n`$(PropertyName)` syntax does not work for some reason.\r\n\r\ncase 2 and 3:\r\nApparently, this is due to the fact that this string is recognized as the path to the file and therefore it tries to return the file name. I do not know if this is how it is intended, but we wonder if we can avoid this somehow.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
