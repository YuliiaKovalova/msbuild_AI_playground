This task must be really easy and hasslefree.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible to redirect the path for a web project without receiving a warning.

See this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45096549/where-is-full-documentation-about-the-csproj-format-for-net-core\r\n\r\nWhen searching for documentation I just find people struggling with setting the output path of a build - again the most rudimentary aspect one would want to configure. For instance in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45750068/setting-of-baseintermediateoutputpath-prevents-running-targets-from-nuget Martin Ulrich comments:\r\n\r\n\"Note that a Directory.Build.props file would be imported early enough in the common props to correctly set BaseIntermediateOutputPath. \u2013 Martin Ullrich\"\r\n\r\nWhile that works for some projects, it does not work clean for AspNet core applications, where setting the BaseIntermediateOutputPath in Directory.Build.Props raises the warning mentioned in my first post above. So in other words the problem raised here is:\r\n\r\nHow can I change the build output directory of an AspNet core application? Setting it in build.props works but gives a warning whose meaning remains unknown.",
