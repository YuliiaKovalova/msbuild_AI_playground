  "body": "Sometimes it is very difficult to understand why some transitive dependencies are copied to the output directory while others aren't.\r\n\r\nIt would greatly help to improve logging in this code:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/XMakeTasks/AssemblyDependency/Reference.cs#L1226-L1247\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we already list all source items in the log:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/XMakeTasks/AssemblyDependency/ResolveAssemblyReference.cs#L1645\r\nIt would be nice to also print their Private metadata if present.\r\n\r\nThis way we can know which one specified their Private=false and let to exclusion. Otherwise we have to double-check in the log elsewhere what the metadata was. It's possible but hard to use.",
