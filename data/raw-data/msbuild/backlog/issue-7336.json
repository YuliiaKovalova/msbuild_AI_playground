  "body": "The schema currently offers completion for `PublicKey` metadata on `InternalsVisibleTo` items. This was added in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6778.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is incorrect as the metadata for setting the public key is named `Key` (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/3439).\r\n\r\nIt may be better to leave the schema as-is and have the item respect `PublicKey` metadata for consistency with the `PublicKey` property, as suggested in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/13289#issuecomment-713355359.",
