  "body": "My `Foo.csproj` uses variables. For example:\r\n````xml\r\n<SolutionName>MyCompany</SolutionName>\r\n<Authors>$(SolutionName)</Authors>\r\n````\r\nIn my build scripts I need to know the value of various properties. I thought that would be possible using the `dotnet` or `msbuild` CLIs, so I tried:\r\n````sh\r\nmsbuild -pp Foo.csproj\r\n````\r\n...but although that merges config, it doesn't render variables.\r\n\r\nPlease add a CLI feature to fully render the csproj. That would make it much easier to use in build environments.\r\n\r\ndotnet 6.0.302  \r\nmsbuild 16.5.0.26101",

Would something like #3911 satisfy your needs?",
