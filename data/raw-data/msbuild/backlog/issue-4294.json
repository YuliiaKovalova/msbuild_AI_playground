  "body": "This is basically the inverse of #2036: it's possible today to log an error from a task but not fail the task, so you get a \"Build SUCCEEDED with 3 errors\" at the end. That's extremely confusing.\r\n\r\nI think this could go with a warning-wave toggle, even though it's introducing a build failure instead of a warning, because it's such bad behavior.",

        "body": "I just wanted to register some interest in this ticket. I'm regularly experiencing this issue at my organisation. I saw it first in Azure DevOps where I've observed build tasks experience errors but register success. The whole build is then registered as a success, which is false. This means the success/failure reporting of an Azure DevOps pipeline is unreliable, which is a pretty major fault for any continuous integration platform.\r\n\r\nI've reported this issue in the [Microsoft Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/544946/azure-devops-msbuild-task-succeeds-despite-errors.html?childToView=569231#comment-569231). I was referred here to report the issue, but am pleased to find I'm not the first to experience it.",
