We've discussed producing a package out of the dotnet/sdk repo to aggregate our Runtime package + other necessary things (this will eventually include the NuGet targets and DLLs too). @jeffkl did we get commitment on that plan?\n",

We'll need another team to provide a package that contains this file as well as the compilers like `csc.exe`.  Those packages will depend on Microsoft.Build.Runtime or your app's project.json will need to include both.\n\nSome of these packages might exist and I'm trying to track them down.  I start a thread today to get some answers.\n",
