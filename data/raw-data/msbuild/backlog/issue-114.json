  "body": "### Summary\n\nTools using Microsoft.Build libraries that specify toolsets in their config file are having those config settings ignored unless the tool _also_ has a MSBuild.exe.config file next to it with a 'toolsVersion' attribute.\n### Cause\n\nThe root of the issue seems to be in `FileUtilities.GetTestExecutionInfo()`. The method checks whether the current executing assembly is a unit test, but the following code is incorrect and will always believe it is running in the context of a unit test:\n\n``` C#\n            // Get the executable we are running\n            var program = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()[0]);\n\n            // Check if it matches the pattern\n            s_runningTests = program != null &&\n                           s_testRunners.Any(s => program.IndexOf(s, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) == -1);\n```\n\nIf running in the context of a unit test, \"msbuild\" is substituted for the actual executable's name when checking for the existence of toolsets in config files (see a few lines later in `FileUtilities.GetTestExecutionInfo()`).\n\nThe end result is that when `TooksetConfigurationReaderHelpers.ConfigurationFileMayHaveToolsets()` checks whether the config file has toolsets or not, it errantly looks in msbuild.exe.config, regardless of the actual tool's config file name or contents.\n",

I made changes to that runningTests flag to be more accurate (it was always returning true before), but also made MSBuild read from msbuild.exe.config in any context (VS or otherwise). Can you reevaluate if this is the behavior you expect? And if you have a scenario not covered please re-open and give details on that. Thanks!\n",

In my case, I have a custom \"host\" which references `Microsoft.Build.*` assemblies and then uses them to build projects (on behalf of XS).
