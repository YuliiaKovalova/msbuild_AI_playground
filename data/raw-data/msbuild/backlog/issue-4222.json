  "title": "Question: how to hook SDK into common targets mechanisms",
  "body": "Hello,\r\nI have run into a conceptual problem related to building my own MSBuild Sdk in combination with Microsoft.NET.Sdk based projects.\r\n\r\nMy MSBuild Sdk needs to hook into the PrepareForBuildDependsOn/BuildDependsOn/etc mechanisms to run certain targets as part of the build.\r\n\r\nThe key problem here seems to be related to import ordering related to `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets` (which defines these properties and overwrites any previous values). This file is imported from Sdk.targets.\r\n\r\nOn https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk?view=vs-2017 it is described how the `Project Sdk` is transformed into implicit imports of the Sdk props/targets.\r\n\r\nThus my own Sdk.targets file needs to be imported *after* setting PrepareForBuildDependsOn/BuildDependsOn/etc in `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets`, so I can append to these values.\r\n\r\nHowever if I include my Sdk reference in the csproj then it will be imported before `Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets` due to the implicit Sdk imports.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to solve this from the csproj file?\r\n\r\nI did notice that the Directory.Build.props/targets mechanism is done after this, but in this specific instance I really would like to know if it can be done without using that\r\n(we have a mix of other/older projects that work correctly because they are not Microsoft.NET.Sdk based and I would like to limit the impact of the 'solution')",
