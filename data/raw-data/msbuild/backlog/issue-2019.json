  "body": "We have a custom task assembly that references the MsBuild 14.0 assemblies (specifically Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core). When running under MsBuild 15 it fails to find the correct assembly. The binder log shows it correctly redirects to version 15.1 but then it only searches the directory containing the custom task and not the MsBuild directory for the assembly. And given that the MsBuild assemblies are not in the GAC anymore a FileNotFoundException happens.\r\n\r\nThe binder log looks like this:\r\n\r\n*** Assembly Binder Log Entry  (27/04/2017 @ 18:18:19) ***\r\n\r\n    The operation failed.\r\n    Bind result: hr = 0x80070002.
