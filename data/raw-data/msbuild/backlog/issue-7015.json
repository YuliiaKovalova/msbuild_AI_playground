This would save us two fields per BuildEventArgs, improve serialization (since we no longer need to pass it across the wire in node packet translator).\r\n\r\nNote that binlog already completely ignores the culture info, and so far it seems to have been fine.\r\n\r\nIt is also really tempting to just delete these two lines for perf reasons:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/24b33188f385cee07804cc63ec805216b3f8b72f/src/Framework/LazyFormattedBuildEventArgs.cs#L83-L84",
