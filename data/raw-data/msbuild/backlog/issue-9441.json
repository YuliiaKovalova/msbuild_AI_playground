  "title": "[Broken Build]: Fresh checkout and attempting to debug ProjectCachePlugin functionality results in errors",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nHi all,\r\n\r\nApologies if I missed documentation explaining this. I'm attempting to set up my local machine to be able to debug MSBuild better. I started with Building MSBuild with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows. That worked fine so I then followed the Using the repository binaries to perform builds instructions to step into the code. That is also working fine. I then created a new project called TestCachePlugin that includes the following ItemGroup: \r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n  <ProjectCachePlugin Include=\"C:\\Github\\msbuild\\artifacts\\bin\\Samples\\ProjectCachePlugin\\Debug\\net8.0\\ProjectCachePlugin.dll\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the net472 artifacts I wasn't seeing the log messages from the plugin being output. I assumed it might have been due to needing to use the net8.0 artifacts, so I started to follow the Building, Testing, and Debugging on .NET Core MSBuild. I run into a bunch of errors though. \r\n\r\nWhen I run `build.cmd -msbuildEngine dotnet` I get errors like the below:\r\n`error MSB3245: Could not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly \"mscorlib\". Check to make sure the assembly exists on disk.`\r\n\r\nGood news I do see the ProjectCachePlugin log messages I include TestCachePlugin in the solution though.\r\n\r\nIf I run `dotnet ./artifacts/bin/bootstrap/net8.0/MSBuild/MSBuild.dll ./src/Samples/TestCachePlugin/TestCachePlugin.csproj` I get `error NETSDK1127: The targeting pack Microsoft.NETCore.App is not installed. Please restore and try again. [C:\\Github\\msbuild\\src\\Samples\\TestCachePlugin\\TestCachePlugin.csproj]`\r\n\r\nAnyone have guidance on how to resolve these issues?\r\n\r\nI'm porting this over from an MSBuild comment so I did truncate the error logs. The version being used is the one set in global.json and at the time of testing it was `8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5`. \n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nThis is a pull request with the changes I've made. https://github.com/Cjewett/msbuild/pull/1/files\r\nFor the most part I didn't change anything about the repository and I've tested this while removing the example project from the solution as well just to confirm repository in its fresh state was working. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nRunning `build.cmd -msbuildEngine dotnet` should succeed and breakpoints should be hit. \r\nRunning ``dotnet ./artifacts/bin/bootstrap/net8.0/MSBuild/MSBuild.dll ./src/Samples/TestCachePlugin/TestCachePlugin.csproj` should succeed and breakpoints should be hit. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nReceive errors related to missing assemblies and targeting packs not being installed. \n\n### Ask us questions\n\n_No response_",
