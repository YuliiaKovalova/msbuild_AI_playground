  "body": "The warning\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSB4130: The condition \"{0}\" may have been evaluated incorrectly in an earlier version of MSBuild. Please verify that the order of the AND and OR clauses is written as intended. To avoid this warning, add parentheses to make the evaluation order explicit.\r\n```\r\nis emitted whenever a condition has an `and` and an `or` in parallel, for example `X and Y or Z`.\r\n\r\nLooking through ancient history, it appears to have been introduced in MSBuild 3.5 in 2007, because a bug in MSBuild 2.0 that caused unexpected evaluation order was fixed then.\r\n\r\nIt feels wrong to emit an informational-only warning about a behavior change that happened 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nEliminating the check for this warning would allow pruning a tree of methods that exist only to provide it. They're currently in the code in `REMOVE_COMPAT_WARNING` regions. I propose to do just what that implies.",
