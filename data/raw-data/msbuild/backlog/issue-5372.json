  "body": "Hello, this has recently regressed and caused my build system to fall over. We manually invoke `dotnet build` with `nice -n20 ionice -c3` to ensure the machine remains responsive during a large build, but this now causes msbuild to crash in recent builds.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the bug is here: https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/236f48ecb51e413c13a16d55b6712df4d0a3ca9f/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L630\r\nMSBuild needs to store the process' current priority instead of assuming it is running at \"Normal\".\r\n\r\nCommit that introduced the regression: https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/commit/b111470ae61eba02c6102374c2b7d62aebe45f5b#diff-3099880c51224257bef6905bc2dfbf3d\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\ndotnet new webapi\r\nnice -n20 dotnet build\r\n\r\nObserve crash.\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB1025: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild.\r\nSystem.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (13): Permission denied\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Process.set_PriorityClassCore(ProcessPriorityClass value)\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Process.set_PriorityClass(ProcessPriorityClass value)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.Execute(String[] commandLine)\r\nUnhandled exception.

In his words:\r\n```\r\nThe process priority documentation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.processpriorityclass?view=netcore-3.1\r\nseems to state that idle would end up starving the build of any real scheduler time slice if you are actually using your machine at all.\r\nThe idea was to give UI/interactive processes priority, so they remain responsive, but to still make progress in the background.\r\n```",
