  "body": "Related to #881, @brthor saw some problems running unit tests for an app that uses MSBuild's construction APIs, but _doesn't_ run builds.\n\nIdeally, we could disambiguate between scenarios: if the user is using our code but doesn't need a toolset, we shouldn't error that we can't find a valid toolset. But if they're starting a build, we need to whine when we can't find a copy of MSBuild.exe to start our multiproc build.\n",
