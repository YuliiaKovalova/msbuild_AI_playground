  "title": "[Broken Build]: After Update to VS 17.14 (It builds with older version)",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nOur build process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we build the entire solution. The second stage is responsible for creating the MSIX packages and with option /p:NoBuild=true.\n\nTo optimize build times, we use the /p:NoBuild=true option during the MSIX packaging stage. Since the binaries have already been produced in the first stage, this option prevents unnecessary rebuilding for each MSIX package, significantly speeding up our build process.\n\nAfter updating to VS 17.14 our second phase of the build fails with errors for each of already built projects\n\n`The 'NoBuild' property was set to true but the 'Build' target was invoked.`\n\n\nWe couldn't figure out how to fix that and decided to diff the build logs between 17.13 and 17.14. This is what we found\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e0eb8bf-3d08-4230-b8e9-c0695fb884e4)\n\nWe traced the issue to this commit\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/1c27ccf4061d8d4aad98371e23b922e50c6c6da7\n\nfrom this pull request https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11167\n\n@vikukush\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI don't have minimal reproducible example, but I uploaded the build logs from both versions of visual studio\n[Binlogs.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20500469/Binlogs.zip)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTo Create MSIX packages with /p:NoBuild=true without errors\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nCannot create MSIX packages with /p:NoBuild=true without errors\n\n### Ask us questions\n\nI need to know if this is a bug, and if you are planning to fix that.

The mentioned change mitigated a problem in the build system, but targets authored by other frameworks still rely on the previous incorrect behavior (in this case it's caused by Microsoft.DesktopBridge.targets).\n\nWe are in contact with DesktopBridge team to understand how fast they can patch the change or we will consider the alternative scenario.\nI will keep you posted!\n",
