  "title": "[Bug]: Typescript compiled in PreBuild event is not included in nuget package when running dotnet pack",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\n[TypescriptPackIssue.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/13973614/TypescriptPackIssue.zip)\r\nI have a Razor class library that contains multiple typescript files.\r\n\r\nOn build I compile these into a scripts.js file that should serve as static web assets in my nuget package.\r\n\r\nIssue: When performing a dotnet pack then the compilation of typescript, resulting in creation of scripts.js, is not included the staticwebassets folder. This is true even if I compile the typescript in a PreBuild event, see it's created, wait a few seconds and then build/pack starts. So at the time of building/packing the file is existing.\r\n\r\nHowever if the scripts.js is present before the dotnet pack then it is included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open the attached project.\r\n2. Run dotnet pack. Notice the scripts.js file is created and execution waits a few seconds and then the nuget package is created.\r\n3. Open the nuget package and conclude that the scripts.js is not present in the folder named \"staticwebassets\".\r\n\r\nTry running step 2 and 3 again without removing the scripts.js. Then conclude that the scripts.js is suddenly there.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen running dotnet pack the typescript compiled during build is present in the created nuget package.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen running dotnet pack the typescript compiled during build is **not** present in the created nuget package.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n_No response_",
