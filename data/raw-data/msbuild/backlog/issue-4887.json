  "title": "Random build failures when using parallel build",
  "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWhen using parallel build with msbuild one can get random build failures due to files being locked. This happens even with nodeReuse:false. This happens both locally and on our Azure Pipeline build. At some point I suspected the virus scanner but the error even happens when the virus scanner is turned off. The only way to prevent this seems to be turning parallel build off (remove the maxcpucount:4).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is the command we use to build our solution:\r\n```\r\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\msbuild.exe\" \"D:\\a\\1\\s\\ANWB Reizen.sln\" /maxcpucount:4 /nodeReuse:False /p:Configuration=Release /p:DeployOnBuild=True /p:DeployDefaultTarget=WebPublish /p:SkipExtraFilesOnServer=True /p:WebPublishMethod=FileSystem /p:publishUrl=D:\\a\\1\\s\\buildoutput\\cmcd /target:Build /verbosity:Quiet\r\n```\r\nThe error we then sometimes get (can happen with any file it seems, not just Lucene.Net.pdb):\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v16.0\\Web\\Deploy\\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.Deploy.FileSystem.targets(96,5): error : \r\nCopying file obj\\Release\\Package\\PackageTmp\\bin\\Lucene.Net.pdb to D:\\a\\1\\s\\buildoutput\\cmcd\\bin\\Lucene.Net.pdb failed. The process cannot access the file 'D:\\a\\1\\s\\buildoutput\\cmcd\\bin\\Lucene.Net.pdb' because it is being used by another process. \r\n[D:\\a\\1\\s\\src\\Foundation\\Macaw\\Logging\\code\\Foundation.Macaw.Logging.csproj]\r\n```",

        "body": "This is likely due to a race condition in your build itself, causing the same projects to be built more than once in the build (or files to be copied to the same path in more than one project).
