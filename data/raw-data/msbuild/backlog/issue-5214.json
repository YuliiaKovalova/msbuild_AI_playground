  "body": "The project references are matched with the nearestBestTargetFramework by the msbuild here  https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/2d82e1a861d890fce68c8e2d42b569e5bbaf5687/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L1630-L1696\r\n  \r\nRuntime repo overloads the tfm to include rids. Currently we guess the target ordering to run our custom logic for finding the bestTargetFramework for p2p references. This approach is prone to \r\nbugs if msbuild changes any logic. \r\n\r\nThe ask here is provide a point of extensibility for developers to inject their custom\\target or task to resolve the project references.\r\n\r\ncc @ericstj @ViktorHofer ",
