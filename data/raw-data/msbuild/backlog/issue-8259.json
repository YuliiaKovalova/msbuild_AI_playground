  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI have several project files that used: `<Configuration Condition=\" '$(Configuration)' == '' \">Release</Configuration>`.\r\nThis stopped working, probably when I updated to MSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `mkdir temp && cd temp && dotnet new console && code temp.csproj`\r\n2. Insert this into the `PropertyGroup`:\r\n\r\n    ```xml\r\n    <Configuration Condition=\" '$(Configuration)' == '' \">Release</Configuration>\r\n    ```\r\n3. `msbuild temp.csproj`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nA release build is made.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nA debug build is made:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/workspace/temp$ dotnet build temp.csproj \r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  All projects are up-to-date for restore.\r\n  temp -> /home/gijsbert/workspace/temp/bin/Debug/net7.0/temp.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nIt seems that the empty string comparison for the value of `'$(Configuration)'` no longer works.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nI've included both the output of `dotnet build --version` and `msbuild --version` as a sanity check to ensure that there's not some installation problem where an unexpected version is run.\r\n```bash\r\ndotnet --version\r\n7.0.101\r\ndotnet build --version\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET\r\nmsbuild --version\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET\r\n```\r\n",

        "body": "@Ghostbird, do you know the .NET SDK and MSBuild versions with which you got different results? I tried .NET SDK 6.0.404 (using MSBuild version 17.3.2+561848881) and .NET SDK 2.1.526 (using MSBuild version 15.9.20+g88f5fadfbe); each of them built the Debug configuration.  I think that happens because of <https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/v6.0.404/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.props#L23>, which was added before SDK v2.0.2.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I move the default `Configuration` to a `Directory.Build.props` file, then it takes effect.",

        "body": "The situation might be different in an old-style project without `<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">`, as that could easily compare and set `Configuration` before MSBuild imports any `*.props` file from .NET SDK.  However, you wrote `dotnet new console` in _Steps to Reproduce_, and I don't think that command would have created such a project in any version of .NET SDK.",

I guess the documentation has just not been updated in several places, such as [this one](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild?view=vs-2022#BKMK_Properties).\r\n\r\nI encountered this issue as I was porting an app from .NET Standard 2.1 Xamarin Forms to .NET 7.0 MAUI. This was accomplished by creating a new MAUI app and porting the source files as appropriate, so that checks out.\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer! I don't mind the new default. I just got really confused because the docs I read said that it's not set by default, and I was wondering if I made an error in the environment set-up.",
