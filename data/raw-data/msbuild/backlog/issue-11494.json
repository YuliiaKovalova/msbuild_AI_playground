  "title": "Remove shared source files",
  "body": "MSBuild repo historically uses source files shared across several projects. This is causing increased NGEN/JIT time, increased assembly size and mainly we are not able to factor our code in the right way due to type full name conflicts.\n\nThis problem could be resolved by several sequential steps/PRs:\n\n- [ ] Identify and resolve all resource duplicates in our projects\n- [ ] Merge all resources to a single resource file inside `Microsoft.Build.Framework` project. Move `ResourceUtilities` and `ErrorUtilities` to the `Microsoft.Build.Framework` and add `AssemblyResources` to make ResourceUtilities work as intended. Remove `AssemblyResources` files from projects with removed resources. Share the new resource file with `MSBuildTaskHost` and fix links to `ResourceUtilities` and `ErrorUtilities`.'\n- [ ] Remove shared files in the `MSBuild` project. This will unlock enablement of `Microsoft.Build` internal types visibility and allow us to move some logic from ``MSBuild` assembly to `Microsoft.Build`.\n- [ ] Incrementally remove rest of the shared sources (move them to the `Framework` project)",
