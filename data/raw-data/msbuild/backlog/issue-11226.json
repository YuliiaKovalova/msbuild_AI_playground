  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhile doing benchmarking for MSBuild, I've noticed a repeated spikes in time consumed.\nThis is annoying for several reasons:\n - it is introducing noise to the benchmarking efforts (the spike is something like +50% time when it occurs)\n - since it is occuring regularly on a cold build it is something that could be affecting pipelines and the spike is large if that is the case.\n - it could be some error manifesting somewhere, but since it is random, it is hard to reproduce.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nRun MSBuild cold build in a loop for a while.\n\n### Data\n\nThe times look like this:\n95.2590266\n53.3364027\n93.6623841\n53.8912314\n51.5191799\n49.8388009\n49.926976\n76.3744426\n\nOr like this:\n57.0661822\n47.0323233\n46.5913615\n44.9238568\n43.7712883\n43.0863718\n50.6900063\n68.8321462\n57.0158222\n43.7932883\n43.5368408\n44.102942\n43.3448263\n\nI would chalk the first one to be the PC doing some weird stuff after a restart, but there is a secondary spike soon after and then one every five or so iterations(sometimes less, sometimes more, but the spike occurs semi regularly.)\nWhy is this happening?\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_\n\n### Regression\n\n- [ ] yes\n- [x] no\n\n### Regression Details\n\n_No response_",

Not sure if it's actionable now.",
