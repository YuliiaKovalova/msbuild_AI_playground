But its text [still says](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/e7019886b3fd520b547a7353d78d106d72a4b828/src/XMakeTasks/Resources/Strings.resx#L2101)\n\n> Note that assemblies will be resolved from the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and will be used in\n> place of reference assemblies. Therefore your assembly may not be correctly targeted for the framework you intend.\n\nThat's misleading now, because this is an error that will stop the build--the user's assembly will no longer be incorrectly targeted.\n",
