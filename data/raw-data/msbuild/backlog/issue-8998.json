  "title": "[Broken Build]: MSBuild should be able to recognize older runtimes' existence doesn't preclude newer runtimes' existence",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI was working on an older branch, and as part of running build.cmd, it put the 7.0.5 runtime in my `.dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App` folder. Then I updated to a newer version, and I got this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/12969783/2eb6cd01-6941-4d91-928c-3ed0795e280b)\r\n\r\nIn reality, I have both the 7.0.8 and and the 8.0 runtime installed. The problem here was just that it didn't realize that.\r\n\r\nDeleting the .dotnet folder and running build.cmd again resolved the issue, and I could build successfully.\r\n\r\n...but it would be good to not make me do that \ud83d\ude42\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nClean repo. Build an old branch. Switch to main and build again.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSuccess after it downloads/finds a new 7.0.7 runtime\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFailure (see picture above)\n\n### Ask us questions\n\n_No response_",
