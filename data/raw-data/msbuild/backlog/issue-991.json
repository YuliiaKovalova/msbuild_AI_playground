  "body": "Hi. I gave a shot on xplat msbuild today and noticed a tiny issue on the wiki page: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild\n\nOn the page, it says you can invoke msbuild by calling\n\n> ./Tools/corerun ./Tools/MSBuild.exe /path/to/project\n\nbut `corerun` is not called any longer on xplat branch starting at https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/commit/51f6d763bdcaf3bdd24c0e0bca352141a94b378 commit as you know.\n\nI tried to create a pull-req on the wiki page but GitHub still doesn't support sending pull-reqs against wiki pages. So, it'd be great if somebody have access rights modify the command example to:\n\n> $ ./Tools/dotnetcli/dotnet ./Tools/MSBuild.exe /path/to/project\n\nMaybe creating a simple wrapper(e.g. msbuild.sh / msbuild.cmd) could be a way to avoid confusion, but it's a different problem.\n",
