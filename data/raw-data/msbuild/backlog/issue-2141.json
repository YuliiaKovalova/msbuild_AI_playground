  "body": "We are trying to use the external entity in XML. When we run msbuild, it calls the xmlpeek task, which seems does not allow DTD by default according to the error from xmlpeek task attached below.\r\n\r\nerror MSB3733: Input file \"...\" cannot be opened. For security reasons DTD is prohibited in this XML document. To enable DTD processing set the DtdProcessing property on XmlReaderSettings to Parse and pass the settings into XmlReader.Create method.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to change the property of DtdProcessing for the xmlpeek task.\r\n",
