  "body": "Ported from : https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/2643 based on email suggestion by @davkean \r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOriginal issue: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5609\r\n\r\n## Repro steps (besides the one in the original bug)\r\n\r\n1. File New Project -> Windows Classic Desktop -> Class Library (.NET Framework)\r\n\r\n2. Install Newtonsoft.Json through NuGet PM UI\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nAfter the process of installation, NuGet invokes `IVsProjectBuildSystem.EndBatchEdit()` [here](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/a87d32b15786d47809449c69b69b1f38b3c8f1a4/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.PackageManagement.VisualStudio/ProjectSystems/VsMSBuildProjectSystem.cs#L607). Immediately after the package dll (lib\\net45\\newtonsoft.json.dll) gets locked.\r\nThis causes a problem in cases when a template (as in one from the original bug's repro steps) tries to uninstall a newly installed package. The result is that the lock on the file prevents it from being deleted or overwritten by another project's installation.\r\n\r\n## Information \r\n\r\nVS: d15rel 26718.0\r\nThis seems to be a regression in the End-to-End behavior since 15.2",
