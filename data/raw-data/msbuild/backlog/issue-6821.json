That fails with:\r\n\r\n> /Users/rolf/test/msbuild-tests/symlinks/test.proj(8,9): error MSB3025: The source file \"source/symlink2\" is actually a directory.  The \"Copy\" task does not support copying directories.\r\n\r\nNow I remove the directory the symlink points to (so that the symlink points to nowhere).\r\n\r\nThis rather strangely works just fine.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that the Copy task doesn't consider symlinks as files when they point to a directory.\r\n\r\nBinlogs: \r\n[binlogs.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/7117696/binlogs.zip)\r\n",

        "body": "In general MSBuild is not very aware of symlinks; we tend to try to see through them to find \"real files\". I suspect this is #703.\r\n\r\nIs this super painful for y'all? We can reevaluate symlinks as inputs to Copy but it'll take some design effort (since we'll need to preserve the \"if you copy a linked file it copies the contents of the file, not the link itself\" behavior we've had for a long time).",
