        "body": "So apparently, initial properties and items do not appear on parallel builds that contain projects with errors or projects that get skipped. It's the same behaviour with dev14. But they appear in sequential builds, so at least there's a workaround. Here's a repro:\r\n[play.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/2298948/play.zip)\r\n\r\nWonder if this is it, or if there are other situations too. I'll start investigating this repro.\r\n",
