  "body": "While updating another project that references the 15.1 binaries and has a few classes that derive from `Task` I started getting errors that those types were not CSLCompliant because the base `Task` type was not CLSCompliant.\n\nIf `Task` was previously CLSCompliant we probably want to keep it that way, if only so customers don't run into these sorts of errors when updating existing projects to use a newer version of MSBuild.\n",
