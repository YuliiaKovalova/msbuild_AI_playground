But have not found any reason why it should not work. Especially that the agents is building solutions without any problems, nuget restore also work properly.\r\nLocally (on developer environment) the nuget pack works fine.\r\n\r\nWorked before? No.\r\n\r\n## Detailed repro steps so we can see the same problem\r\n\r\n`nuget pack \"ConsoleApplication1\\ConsoleApplication1.csproj\" -Verbosity detailed -Properties Configuration=Release`\r\n\r\n## Other suggested things\r\n\r\nIt might be some problems with MSBuild itself.\r\nThe same issue occurs for NuGet 4.4.1.4656\r\nRight now my workaround is not using the csproj for nuget pack, but defining everything inside the nupkg.\r\n\r\n### Verbose Logs\r\n\r\n> NuGet Version: 4.6.2.5055\r\n> Attempting to build package from 'ConsoleApplication1.csproj'.\r\n> MSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '15.7.179.6572' from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\15.0\\bin'.
