  "body": "Hi,\r\nplease help localization team to answer question from translator.\r\nIn case translator is not sure about context/meaning/localizability of string we raise a question.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\nMSB4252: Project \"{0}\" with global properties\\r\\n ({1})\\r\\n is building project \"{2}\" with global properties\\r\\n ({3})\\r\\n with the ({4}) target(s) but the build result for the built project is not in the engine cache. In isolated builds this could mean one of the following:\\r\\n - the reference was called with a target which is not specified in the ProjectReferenceTargets item in project \"{0}\"\\r\\n - the reference was called with global properties that do not match the static graph inferred nodes\\r\\n - the reference was not explicitly specified as a ProjectReference item in project \"{0}\"\\r\\n \r\n\r\nFile Name:\r\nBuild\\Resources\\xlf\\Strings.xlf\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\nQuery:\r\nWould you please let us know what will replace the placeholder {4}? Will it be a number of a list of target(s)?",
