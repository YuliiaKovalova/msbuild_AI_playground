  "body": "MSBuild already has (internal) support for validating the msbuild project files and several public tasks that deal with Xml files (XmlPeek/XmlPoke/XslTransformation).\r\n\r\nHowever, it currently seems to be missing a buildin task for validating an xml to a xsd.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to start a discussion on the feature request for a new buildin MSBuild task that can perform xsd validation on an xml file.\r\n\r\nInputs to this task should be:\r\n* XsdInputPath\r\n* XmlInputPath\r\n\r\nNot sure if checking multiple xml files and/or XmlContent would be relevant (XslTransformation task has something similar)\r\n\r\n",
