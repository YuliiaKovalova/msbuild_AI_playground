  "body": "This issue tracks part of issue #3139 (RAR as service).\r\nThe target of this issue is to deliver an option and functionality to start a node that can act as a RAR node.\r\n\r\nThis is the second attempt to deliver this functionality (previous attempt: issue #5555). The previous work (PR #5613) was reverted because of the use of StreamJsonRPC. We have decided to keep using the existing serialization technology based on BinaryFormatter. BinaryFormatter will be replaced in all of MSBuild IPC later. We will reuse the previous work and remove the usage of StreamJsonRPC in favor of BinaryFormatter. ",
