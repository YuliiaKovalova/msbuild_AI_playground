  "title": "No output to terminal if a malformed argument is provided",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIf a mistake is made in passing arguments to `dotnet msbuild`, no output related to the error is printed to the terminal. I ran into this in an application where MSBuild is invoked as an external process via the `Process` class and the output is redirected to a stream to be consumed in the calling application.\n\nThe only way to get the actual reason for the failure appears to be via a binary log file with `-bl`.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfae2022-0a9d-47cb-87af-ac855699f30e)\n\nThis makes diagnosing issues, particularly in CI environments, much more difficult to get to the bottom of than it should be.\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open a terminal in a directory containing an MSBuild project/solution.\n2. Run a command such as the following where an argument is invalid: `dotnet msbuild /t:Restore \"/p:foo =bar\" -v:diag`\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe error is printed to the terminal, in this case:\n\n```text\nMSBUILD error MSB4177: Invalid property. The name \"foo \" contains an invalid character \" \".\n```\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOnly the command passed to MSBuild is rendered to the console\n\n```pwsh\n\u276f dotnet msbuild /t:Restore \"/p:foo =bar\" -v:diag\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.200-preview.0.24575.35\\MSBuild.dll -distributedlogger:Microsoft.DotNet.Tools.MSBuild.MSBuildLogger,C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.200-preview.0.24575.35\\dotnet.dll*Microsoft.DotNet.Tools.MSBuild.MSBuildForwardingLogger,C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.200-preview.0.24575.35\\dotnet.dll -maxcpucount -tlp:default=auto -verbosity:m -v:diag /p:foo =bar /t:Restore .\\DotNetOutdated.csproj\n\n\u276f $LASTEXITCODE\n1\n```\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n- dotnet --version: `9.0.200-preview.0.24575.35`\n- dotnet msbuild --version: `17.13.0.56904`\n",
