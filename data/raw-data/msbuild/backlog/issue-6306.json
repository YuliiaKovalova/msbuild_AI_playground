  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6174 made progress on the issue with tasks understanding WarningsAsErrors, but there's still work to do.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate a task that returns `!Log.HasLoggedErrors`\r\nSet up your build such that:\r\n1. All warnings will be treated as errors.\r\n2. Add a different warning to be treated as a message.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nTask returns true.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nTask will return false.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nSee my comment in this PR: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6304.\r\n\r\nBecause of the implied rule that a non-null empty set of WarningsAsErrors means that all warnings are treated as errors, there's no way to have a single set that represents whether or not any given warning should be treated as an error.\r\n\r\n",
