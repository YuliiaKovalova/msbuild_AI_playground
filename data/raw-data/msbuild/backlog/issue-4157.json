  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. start with an existing .NET Framework 4.6 solution that includes a web project\r\n2. from the command line, run `msbuild -p:DeployOnBuild=true -p:WebPublishMethod=Package -p:PackageAsSingleFile=true` --> a zip is outputted with Content items and a bin folder containing relevant dll's\r\n3. Convert the project to use the new csproj (but still running .NET Framework 4.6)\r\n4. from the command line, run `msbuild -p:DeployOnBuild=true -p:WebPublishMethod=Package -p:PackageAsSingleFile=true` --> the .zip file that gets outputted contains the contents of the output directory (i.e. a bunch of dll's, views, and items we've specified to be copied to the output directory via the <CopyToOutputDirectory> tag), rather than Content items and the bin folder.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\na deployable zip w/ Content items, config-related fiels (e.g. web.config), and a bin folder w/ dll's\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\na zip w/ the contents of the output directory\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.5.180.51428 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
