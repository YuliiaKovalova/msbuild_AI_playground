  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nTrying to debug a legacy Xamarin iOS application. I have connected to a mac, resolved my versions of XCode, and have a simulator selected and on standy. When I attempt to build this is I recieve the issue below.:\r\n\r\n   \r\n   HERE IS MY MAIN.CS BLOCK:\r\n           static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            string documentsPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal); // Documents folder\r\n            string libraryPath = Path.Combine(documentsPath, \"..\", \"Library\"); // Library folder            \r\n            ScDistISwitch.Shared.UIConstants.DatabasePath = libraryPath;\r\n            setAppVersion();\r\n            AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += CurrentDomain_UnhandledException;\r\n            //for certificate chain issue\r\n            System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, cert, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;\r\n            // if you want to use a different Application Delegate class from \"AppDelegate\"\r\n            // you can specify it here.\r\n            UIApplication.Main(args, null, typeof(AppDelegate));\r\n        }\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nIts hard to reproduce this because I truly have no idea what the issue is. It is a Xamarin.iOS app that uses a Shared Portable library for platform-independant code.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nSeverity\tCode\tDescription\tProject\tFile\tLine\tSuppression

        "body": "The stack trace gives me the impression that XamlCTask is trying to load a PDB file that is in an unsupported format or is somehow corrupt.\r\n\r\nCan you find out which PDB file it is trying to load?  If you can monitor file I/O, then it's probably the PDB file that was opened last.\r\n\r\nThe MsfDirectory class at <https://github.com/dotnet/cecil/blob/13d6536e2dc92404da76d61d248badc040eb0de0/symbols/pdb/Microsoft.Cci.Pdb/MsfDirectory.cs> looks like it parses a Windows-style Program Database rather than a Portable PDB. That is a newer version of Mono.Cecil than what you're using, as your stack trace includes Mono.Cecil.Pdb.PdbReader.PopulateFunctions(), which was deleted in <https://github.com/dotnet/cecil/commit/fbb3c444bba3086f26c03bca8928307dd4ac6883>.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the PDB file being loaded is a portable PDB but your version of Mono.Cecil is too old to support that.  If so, you could perhaps work around that by changing the `DebugType` property.",

This does not seem a bug in MSBuild itself.  It would be interesting to know which version of Xamarin that is and whether the incompatibility has been documented \u2014 although if the version is already out of support then maybe MS won't bother to document.",
