        "body": "Errors prefixed with `CS` come from the compiler (csc.exe).  I would recommend you file an issue at https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/ if you want it to be more clear.  As far as I know, you can't use the `is` statement with a null, so I'm surprised to hear that it compiles for you locally but not on your build server.  I wonder if your build server is using MSBuild 4.0 and an older version of the compiler?\r\n\r\nI'm closing this since its not an MSBuild issue.",
