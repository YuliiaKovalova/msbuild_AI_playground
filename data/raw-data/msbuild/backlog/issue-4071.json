  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have a sample project which I was attempting to build (on a Bamboo CI machine) using these steps:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsbuild /t:restore;build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gave an error\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer. Use NuGet Package Restore to download them.\u00a0 For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=322105. The missing file is ..\\packages\\Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.2.0.1\\build\\net46\\Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.props.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then tried changing the build step to\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsbuild /restore /t:build\r\n```\r\n\r\nand still got the same error. \r\nI then tried using two build steps instead of one\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsbuild /t:restore\r\nmsbuild /t:build\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\nmsbuild /restore\r\nmsbuild /t:build\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the same error persisted. Finally I had to change the build to do\r\n\r\n```\r\nnuget.exe restore\r\nmsbuild /t:build\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the solution then builds successfully.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\nMSBuild Version: Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 15.8.169+g1ccb72aefa for .NET Framework\r\n\r\nNuGet Version: 4.4.1.4656\r\nMSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '15.8.169.51996' from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\15.0\\bin'.\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows Server 2012 (probably R2, not sure though)\r\n\r\nBamboo CI server\r\n\r\n### References\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/3000#issuecomment-417675215\r\nand https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/2811 \r\n\r\n### Followup\r\nThe solution, projects and builds logs contain proprietary information and I cannot paste them here. If there is something specific you want from the log I can probably extract that.\r\n",

The latter is only supported with an explicit `nuget.exe restore`, which was the only option at the time it was current. Since then, `PackageReference` has been added, enabling the smoother `msbuild /restore` experience.",
