  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nHello, \r\nmany GNU/Linux systems have only \"one\" locale installed that is not `en_US`. On such systems `dotnet build` will fail to execute because it will not be possible to `setlocale`.\r\n\r\nI started digging when I hit this issue when building Powershell, see: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/20941\r\nAnd found: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/5cf78584f998e524374758c5798b7054bf2595e9/src/Tasks/Exec.cs#L597\r\n\r\nWhy can't there be a mechanism to refuse to build if current locale does not support utf-8, maybe even match on current `LANG` ***and*** `LC_ALL` and when none of them has `.utf8`, then switch?\r\n\r\nOr am I completely wrong and somehow exactly `en_US` is needed?\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nsee https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/20941\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nsee https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/20941\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nsee https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/20941\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
