  "body": "(inciting incident is https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/pull/601#discussion_r1941818975 but we've had this thought for a long time)\n\nBy default, global properties for the current project flow to projects built with the MSBuild task, unless overridden or explicitly removed with `RemoveProperties` in the MSBuild task call. This makes some sense for \"regular\" projects that build things (though see #9414), but there's another use of the MSBuild task: to ensure that some operation happens _exactly once_ during a build no matter how big that build is--for instance \"get some expensive value out of the git repo state\" or \"generate a version file for this build\". But there's no way to specify \"I promise that this project I am calling will _only_ care about the _explicit_ list of properties I pass it\" so you're forced to add a bunch of stuff to `RemoveProperties=\"TargetFramework;Configuration;Platform;...\"` which is inevitably incomplete.",
