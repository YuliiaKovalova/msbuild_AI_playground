  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\nThis is feedback by @RussKie:\r\n\r\n> the warning messages - they look inconsistent - in the code a variable is declared as `$(Name)`, yet the message uses `Property [Name]...` or just `...variable: Name.`. Any reason not to output `Property '$(Name)'...`?\r\n> \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29948c9e-3762-4cbb-9cb5-b2c3105504d4)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8160d4d-4f1d-4981-9eb1-860d6c682184)\r\n> With that, the messages would look like: `Property '$(Name)' was accessed...` and `Property '$(Name)' is derived from an env var`.\r\n\r\nSince we are refering to references within MSBuild scripts - sticking to that syntaxt feels as a great improvement.\r\nFYI @baronfel - do agree with the suggestion?",
