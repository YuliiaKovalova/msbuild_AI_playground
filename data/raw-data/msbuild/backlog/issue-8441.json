  "title": "Review current RAR design in light of modern .NET projects",
  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\n#8422 strives to improve the performance of ResolveAssemblyReferences. This issue tracks the work to understand the actual role of RAR in modern .NET app builds. For example, reference assemblies in the SDK seem to be passed to RAR already resolved (as in, specified by full paths and transitively closed), so it is possible that some of the work done by RAR can be simplified or omitted.\r\n\r\n## Expected outputs\r\n\r\n- A description of the subset of RAR functionality that is needed in modern .NET builds.\r\n- A design proposal for a leaner \"RAR 2.0\" (possibly, but not necessarily, a new task/target).",
