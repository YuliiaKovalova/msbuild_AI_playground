First, the build fails with max pipe path restrictions. If the temp path size is reduced to fix the max pipe problem, then the nodes cannot connect to each other. This seems to be a pipe connection problem, happening before node handshake.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/3878/files#diff-e0867d8b97cbf5f59c67c5547a686c96R327",
