  "body": "Reproduction code here: https://github.com/dfaivre/bugrepro_dotnetcore_missingmethod\r\n\r\n*It is only my best guess that this is an MSBuild issue with the \"new\" csproj format.  Maybe it's a NuGet issue?  Or possibly the an issue with the way the library is packaged? Sorry if I'm wasting your time.*\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\nUsing VS2016 RC, when referencing `Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost` (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost/) nuget package in a .NET Core project that targets `net461`, a `MissingMethodException` \r\nis thrown when trying to create an HttpClient:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError Message:\r\n System.MissingMethodException : \r\n   Method not found: 'System.Net.Http.HttpClient Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost.TestServer.CreateClient()'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also thrown when creating a \"classic\" .NET Framework class library and using `PackageReferences` for NuGet.\r\n\r\nThe exception is not thrown when targeting `netcoreapp1.0`, or when creating a \"classic\" .NET Framework class library using `packages.config` for NuGet.\r\n\r\n**System Info**\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Professional 2017 RC\r\nVersion 15.0.26127.0 D15REL\r\nMicrosoft .NET Framework\r\nVersion 4.6.01586\r\n\r\nInstalled Version: Professional\r\n\r\nASP.NET and Web Tools 2016   15.0.30124.0\r\nASP.NET and Web Tools 2016\r\n\r\nASP.NET Web Frameworks and Tools 2013   5.2.50105.0\r\nFor additional information, visit https://www.asp.net/\r\n\r\nNuGet Package Manager   4.0.0\r\nNuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
