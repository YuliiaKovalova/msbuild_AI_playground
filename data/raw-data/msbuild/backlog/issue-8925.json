  "body": "### Background \r\n #6215\r\n Similar (and can be taken together with) https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/8924\r\n This subitem is focused on unit tests calling using BinaryFormatter:\r\n * Build.UnitTests - testing deserializing exceptions\r\n * Framework.UnitTests - testing deserialization of EventArgs, AssemblyNameEx, CopyOnWriteDictionary\r\n * Removing `EnableUnsafeBinaryFormatterSerialization` requried bacause of the above unit tests - https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/Directory.Build.props#L46-L52\r\n \r\nSince this is non-shipping code, it's not a priority. However it should be easy to get rid of those and hence make usages of `BinaryFormatter` in our code base scope to the necessary places (e.g. `GenerateResource` task)`\r\n\r\n### Suggested approach\r\nUnit tests testing exceptions and EventArgs serialization should be moved to the new serialization mechanisms for those (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/8786, https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8917), or delete if duplicate with unittests introduced as part of those new serialization mechanisms, or removed if serializing other types (as those should not currently use BinaryFormatter for de/serialization).",
