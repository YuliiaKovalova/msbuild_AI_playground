  "title": "Documentation of property flow in MSBuild Task",
  "body": "Where is the documentation describing which properties do, or do not, flow from a parent project to the project invoked via an MSBuild task? For example consider:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n <!-- Parent.proj --> \r\n<Project>\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n        <WhatsThat>Oh yeah</WhatsThat>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n    <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n        <MSBuild Project=\"Child.proj\" />\r\n    </Target>\r\n<Project>\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhen Example.proj is being built which of the following property types are passed from Parent.proj to Child.proj:\r\n\r\n- Global properties: are the global properties of Parent.proj available in Child.proj?\r\n- Environment properties: no environment, the original environment passed to Parent.proj or any modifications to environment properties which were done by Parent.proj? \r\n- Local properties: what is the value of `$(WhatsThat)` inside Child.proj?\r\n\r\nIt's easy to drum up a few experiments to see what the values are here. But I'm a bit wary of using experiments here because there are subtlties to MSBuild that I may be missing. Curious where there is documentation specifying what the intended behavior is here. \r\n\r\n",
