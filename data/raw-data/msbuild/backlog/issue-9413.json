  "body": "### Summary\n\nThe SdkResolverService currently logs [when it is about to resolve SDKs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/9a0cef6f75bf13ffbbde956b8f7d7ad7d6e0d996/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/SdkResolution/SdkResolverService.cs#L315), but it never logs the results of resolving SDKs - this can make it difficult to use binlogs to diagnose SDK resolution problems, since the only other option is to gather ETW traces, which is not always doable.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nWhile helping @jaredpar with https://github.com/jaredpar/complog/pull/73 we found this gap in the binlogs, which was a major head-scratch moment.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nMSBuild should log the final results of SDK resolution to the logger in some form - ideally more than just errors would be logged because sometimes the SDK resolution result itself can be outside of what the user is expecting.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
