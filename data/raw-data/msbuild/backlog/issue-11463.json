  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWe started seeing this error when some of our devs upgraded to 17.13.9.7704 from 17.11.2.32701.\n\nfoo.sln(1,1): error MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded. Data at the root level is invalid. Line 1, position 1.\n\nTurns out this section of the sln file is invalid according to msbuild 17.13.9.x \nGlobalSection(DevPartner Solution Properties) = postSolution\n\tEndGlobalSection\n\nAfter removing this section from the sln file the error went away. Seems to be something related to MicroFocus.\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nUpgrade msbuild from  17.11.2.32701. to 7.13.9.7704 against a solution that looks like:\n\n```\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 11.00\n# Visual Studio 2010\nProject(\"{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}\") = \"foo\", \"bar.csproj\", \"{DB35CD3D-452D-40D2-B5A4-96F009AC4C98}\"\nEndProject\nGlobal\n\tGlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution\n\t\tDebug|Any CPU = Debug|Any CPU\n\t\tRelease|Any CPU = Release|Any CPU\n\tEndGlobalSection\n\tGlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution\n\t\t{DB35CD3D-452D-40D2-B5A4-96F009AC4C98}.Debug|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Debug|Any CPU\n\t\t{DB35CD3D-452D-40D2-B5A4-96F009AC4C98}.Debug|Any CPU.Build.0 = Debug|Any CPU\n\t\t{DB35CD3D-452D-40D2-B5A4-96F009AC4C98}.Release|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Release|Any CPU\n\t\t{DB35CD3D-452D-40D2-B5A4-96F009AC4C98}.Release|Any CPU.Build.0 = Release|Any CPU\n\tEndGlobalSection\n\tGlobalSection(SolutionProperties) = preSolution\n\t\tHideSolutionNode = FALSE\n\tEndGlobalSection\n\tGlobalSection(DevPartner) = postSolution\n\tEndGlobalSection\n\tGlobalSection(DevPartner) = postSolution\n\tEndGlobalSection\nEndGlobal\n```\n\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nPerhaps a better error if DevPartner Solution Properties is no longer valid.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nFails to run solution and reports Data at the root level is invalid. Line 1, position 1.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
