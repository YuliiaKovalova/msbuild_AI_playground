  "title": "Reduce dependence on CodeTaskFactory in tests",
  "body": "Many tests require a one-off task that behaves in a specific way, and were written to use CodeTaskFactory to generate a task assembly on the fly.  Since we don't have a short-term plan to support CodeTaskFactory cross-platform, we should reconsider this approach.  One possibility would be to produce a single `Test.Microsoft.Build.TestTasks.dll` or similar and use it from the various tests.\n",
