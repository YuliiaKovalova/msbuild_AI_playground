  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nIn [this feedback ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/visual-studio-gets-confused-when-i-run-msbuild/1589332) I advised a customer to set the `MSBuildDebugEngine` environment variable to `1`. When they did so they received...\r\n\r\n> error : The type initializer for \u2018Microsoft.Build.Shared.Debugging.DebugUtils\u2019 threw an exception.\r\n\r\n...for each of the three non-SDK-style .csproj projects in their solution.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAs above. This is customer reported and I don't have much information at this point.\r\n\r\nFeel free to engage the customer via the feedback ticket directly.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo exception.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nException.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of type initializer logic in: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/518c041f4511a6bc23eb40703b69a94ea46c65fd/src/Shared/Debugging/DebugUtils.cs\r\n\r\nI've asked if they have more information in the Event Viewer.\r\n\r\nFeel free to engage the customer via the feedback ticket directly.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 2022 version 17.0.4\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n\r\nThis exception means we are blocked on getting build logs.",

        "body": "I can repro this locally. The cause is, perhaps, unsurprising:\r\n\r\n> UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Preview\\MSBuild_Logs' is denied.\r\n\r\nThe workaround then is to set `MSBUILDDEBUGPATH` to a writeable path.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I believe the situation could be improved for the end user who stumbles into this. Either by unwrapping the `TypeInitializerException` when reporting in VS, and perhaps by including a better exception message that explains use of the `MSBuild_Logs` environment variable.",
