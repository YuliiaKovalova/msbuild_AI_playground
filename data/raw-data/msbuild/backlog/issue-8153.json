  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWe think we found a regression in MSBuild on VS 17.5.0 Preview 2.0. Apparently a property is disappearing when an item is being added to a collection.\r\n\r\nWe call a task with some items. They go in and come out correctly (they have the BasePath property).\r\nWe add the outputs back to the item group.\r\nWhen they are added, the BasePath property is missing.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995051/201186542-f42a9605-286e-45ca-a68e-6433ff80ee8e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995051/201186848-f2e8659b-95d8-45b8-b682-012c086239ce.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995051/201186879-43c70812-fd01-4f4e-9323-36cc6a8a53af.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995051/201186897-bdd96bd8-5982-478a-a2f6-0b71fb915477.png)\r\n \r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n* File new project MVC with (individual auth)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nMetadata items are preserved\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe BasePath metadata item is lost\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nAnalysis is above.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nMSBuild version 17.5.0-preview-22558-04+15b127d24 for .NET Framework\r\n17.5.0.55804",
