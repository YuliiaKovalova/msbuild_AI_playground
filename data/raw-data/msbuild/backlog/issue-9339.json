Properties, Items, and Target results cannot be obtained. See details in stderr above.`\n\n### Analysis\n\nI'm trying to get the resolved assemblies that are invoking `dotnet restore`.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n`dotnet --version`\r\n\r\n8.0.100-rc.2.23502.2\r\n\r\n`dotnet msbuild --version`\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.8.0+6cdef4241 for .NET\r\n17.8.0.47204",

        "body": "This looks pretty interesting, but the first thing that jumps out at me is `dotnet restore --getProperty` is a bit unusual, since it'll specify targets to build (that's how restore is done) and also request that property.\r\n\r\nWas there any output to stderr?\r\n\r\nThis isn't a good error experience, which we should look at--but if you describe what you want in slightly more detail we may be able to help you out.",
