  "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI can reproduce the issue - Build won't finish dotnet/extensions#1406  ( https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/9034 ) . This issue is still not fixed. Today I have installed fresh copy of VS 2022 version 17.5.1 Professional (64-bit) licensed edition in my organization computer.  I was observing this issue for last 15 days recurrently and it was wasting my time like anything. Today i used process explorer to monitor what is going wrong and also started build using commandline dotnet build command with detailed logged enabled. \r\n\r\nMy observations are -  \r\n\r\n- Build keeps executing CopyToOutputDirectory action  to copy apphost.exe from obj folder to bin folder for infinite amount of time.  We cancel the build by Build -> Cancel option or control+c  then onwards MSBuild stuck infite with error - MSB4220: Waiting for the currently executing task \"Copy\" to cancel.  [ project name ]. \r\n- There are 3 MSBuild.exe running. First cancel stops/kills 1 MSBuild.exe\r\n- 2 MSBuild.exe still running and then error starts coming on screen -  MSB4220: Waiting for the currently executing task \"Copy\" to cancel\r\n\r\nproject type - asp.net core web api \r\n.net version - 6.0 sdk\r\nVS version - VS 2022 version 17.5.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild should not hang if it fails to copy the files, there should be some timeout and then throw exception notifying user of details. Right now i let it wait and build keeps waiting for hours ( i let it run overright and checked in the morning, it was still waiting for the copy operation to finish).\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\nI can reproduce the issue - Build won't finish dotnet/extensions#1406  ( https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/9034 ) .
