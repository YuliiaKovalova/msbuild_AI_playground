  "body": "(result of a conversation offline with @angocke)\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the performance summary, you often see numbers like\r\n\r\n```\r\n2274870 ms  ResolveProjectReferences                  71 calls\r\n200719 ms  CoreCompile                               71 calls\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's quite surprising to see ResolveProjectReferences take so long. It's happening because time spent waiting on the references to build from within one project (while the node is yielded and hopefully doing other useful work) is attributed to the MSBuild task and to RPR.\r\n\r\nWe should consider adding a \"self time\" column to the output to report time spent in tasks and targets _excluding time the node is yielded_. That would help understand where the time is actually being spent.",
