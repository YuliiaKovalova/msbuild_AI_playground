  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI've logged this here https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/32382\r\n\r\nWe have a project which only runs on windows x64 and uses Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite\r\n\r\nI notice in the bin folder there are sqlite dependencies for just about every computer on earth... How can we prevent these from being emitted?\r\n\r\nand was asked to follow up with msbuild team\r\n\r\nWe use efcore in our project however we only target win-x64 environments, can msbuild do something to allow efcore to only emit the architecture files needed for supported architectures.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nAdd efcore to a project which only targets win-x64 and build it, check the bin folder and you will see that all the architectures are included.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOnly the architectures we are targetting should make it to the bin folder.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAll architectures are in the bin folder.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "Hello @catmanjan.\r\nThank you for raising the issue. \r\nAfter investigation and reproducing the issue, it was identified that this is sdk behaviour by design\r\nIt seems that the issue was already opened for SDK team https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/37147, thank you for that. \r\nMeanwhile if there is a need to build only for some specific architecture it is possible to use RuntimeIdentifier as was suggested in comment: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/13039#issuecomment-1825303224\r\n\r\ncc @JanKrivanek, @baronfel maybe something that could be considered as part of https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9380\r\n",
