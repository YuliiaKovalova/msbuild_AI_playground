  "title": "[Feature Request]: Allow packaging framework-dependent apps into an MSIX package",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's not possible to package framework-dependent apps into an MSIX package. With a switch to set self-contained to be false, we could have MSIX packages with applications that are framework-dependent.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nI'm using a Bootstrapper which combines the advantages of self-contained and framework-dependent deployment (for context, see [here](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper)). Currently, I cannot use that bootstrapper for applications that I package with MSIX.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nAdd a switch to set self-contained to be false when packaging an app into an MSIX package.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n_No response_",
