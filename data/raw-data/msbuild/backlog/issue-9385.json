  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI just discovered that Property reassignment events are logged as plain messages, and not as PropertyReassignmentEventArgs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/31c4d335325e858a3c4dba66d921d0e31bdee5ff/src/Build/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L1351-L1357\r\n\r\nI don't know how I've missed this previously. If we log the structured event, we don't need to materialize the long string message at all.\r\n\r\nHere's where we log the real event args, but I suspect this code is not currently enabled:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/31c4d335325e858a3c4dba66d921d0e31bdee5ff/src/Build/Evaluation/PropertyTrackingEvaluatorDataWrapper.cs#L294-L300\r\n\r\n",
