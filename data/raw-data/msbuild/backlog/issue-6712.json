  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nThis deadlock has been detected while [investigating](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1266942)\r\nThis bug has surfaced as hang at `BuildManager.EndBuild`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nThis race condition triggered deadlock is very hard to reproduce.\r\nHowever there are many [CABs](https://watsonportal.microsoft.com/Failure?FailureSearchText=d4d1af51-5544-7507-5c16-5c828d97462c&DateRange=Last%2014%20Days&DateTimeFormat=UTC&MaxRows=100&DisplayMetric=CabCount) which includes `devenv` process dump which helped during issue investigation.\r\n\r\nI have used [this CAB](https://watsonportal.microsoft.com/CabAnalysis?CabIdentifier=https://weus2watcab01.blob.core.windows.net/global-202107/73656863-4da4-4203-876e-aa02b067c188.zip) during investigation.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nDuring execution BuildManager.ExecuteSubmission if build is canceled at particular time and following if branch is entered\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/38eec6f7a1225ddf957e7793ec35695da1f01a75/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs#L1132-L1141\r\nLine https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/38eec6f7a1225ddf957e7793ec35695da1f01a75/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs#L1138 will block inside `_syncLock` and wait for all messages of logging service to be processed. Processing messages of logging service is performed on thread pool and it could callback BuildManager, for example:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/38eec6f7a1225ddf957e7793ec35695da1f01a75/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs#L2815-L2818\r\nLocking `_syncLock` in callback from `LoggingService` concludes this deadlock.\r\n\r\nProve:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25249058/127208070-f452b78e-a68b-489c-8049-a099629d8720.png)\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nCode as is, is very fragile and hard to maintain. We shall strategically avoid, if possible, infinite lock-blocking callbacks from `LoggingService` into `BuildManager`\r\nProposed solution:\r\n- Code in `OnProjectStarting/Finishing` seems to be dead. Nothing uses its results. I recommend to delete it and stop propagating project started and finished to BuildManager.\r\n- `OnThreadException` \r\n  - shall either somehow detect possible deadlock and throws with inner exception\r\n  - or use lock timeout and throws with inner exception after timeout\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nThis error might have been there for ages, at least since 2018 commit https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/764fe79d6fc68061074345a65c87c67ca14710cb.\r\n",
