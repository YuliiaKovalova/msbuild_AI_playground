That allowed us to make some changes that broke it (because it compiles for CLR 2, which is its raison d'\u00eatre, but also shares code with our other assemblies, switching to `Marshal.SizeOf<T>()` instead of `Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(T))` caused trouble).\n\nI noticed this when porting changes into the Microsoft-internal copy of the source.\n",

(MSBuildTaskHost was initially introduced in part because of issues with 4.X+ tasks downtargeting.) \n",
