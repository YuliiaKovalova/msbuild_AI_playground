        "body": "This is an unfortunate consequence of MSBuild's \"define a new variable simply by assigning to it\" model--it's perfectly legitimate to define metadata named `Verison`, it's just that nothing pays attention to that.\r\n\r\nWhen editing with Visual Studio, IntelliSense should complete the correctly-spelled form for you, which helps somewhat. If we had a language service (https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1774), we could potentially warn on low-edit-distance errors from known names.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's much that we can do to cause an actual error here.",
