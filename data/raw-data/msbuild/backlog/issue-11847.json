  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI went to upgrade the `Microsoft.Build` NuGet package in one of our projects today.\n\nI noticed there was a fairly new release (a few of them actually...):\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build/17.14.8#versions-body-tab\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c63e0a75-b51d-420d-a35b-05175e527aa8)\n\nAfter picking `17.14.8`, I got a build error on my project:\n\n```\n Unable to find package Microsoft.Build.Framework with version (>= 17.14.8)\n  - Found 57 version(s) in nuget.org [ Nearest version: 17.13.9 ]\n  - Versions from Affinitiv were not considered\n  - Versions from Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages were not considered\n```\n\n```\n Unable to find package Microsoft.NET.StringTools with version (>= 17.14.8)\n  - Found 18 version(s) in nuget.org [ Nearest version: 17.13.9 ]\n  - Versions from Affinitiv were not considered\n  - Versions from Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages were not considered\n```\n\nTurns out the required dependent versions of both `Microsoft.Build.Framework` as well as `Microsoft.NET.StringTools` have not been updated appropriately when `Microsoft.Build` was updated.\n\nBoth still point to version `17.13.9` \n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.StringTools/\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc056949-ca85-4f8e-8459-4b4cb032ebc2)\n\nhttps://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Framework/#versions-body-tab\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95953a18-9ee4-424d-9488-0412a92a752c)\n\nWhile `Microsoft.Build` requires version `>=17.14.8` for both:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485081e7-a03e-46e7-babc-abe32d204cf0)\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nInstall `Microsoft.Build` latest NuGet version.\nTry to build the project.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nProject should build successfully.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nBuild fails with missing transitive dependent versions of `Microsoft.Build.Framework` and `Microsoft.NET.StringTools`.\n\n### Analysis\n\nI don't know how the publish to NuGet process works for `Microsoft.Build` package, but for whatever reasons, it was pushed while its dependencies were not.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild version 17.14.8+a7a4d5af0 for .NET Framework\n17.14.8.25101",
