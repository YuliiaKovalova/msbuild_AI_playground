If so, please comment here. Thank you!\" Then add needs:Author Feedback label.\r\n2) Once per week (or more often), look at all needs:Author Feedback-labelled issues.\r\na) If an issue has not been responded to by anyone, and the label was applied at least 3 weeks ago, close it.\r\nb) If an issue has been responded to by a non-MSBuild maintainer but not an MSBuild maintainer, remove the needs:Author Feedback label and apply untriaged.\r\nc) If an issue has been responded to by both, remove the needs:Author Feedback label but do not apply untriaged.\r\n\r\nSound reasonable?",

Maryam, can we enable the labeler in SDK repo to label issues now as I think there are enough items with each label to try that out? Does the labeler work for the scenario described above of trying to shut down older tickets or is it just for labeling? Would there be a different bot that other team's use?",

Just because an issue is old, doesn't mean it's not real.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think there's room to improve the case where we request specific additional information because we don't understand the bug or can't repro it and don't get that information.

A lot of issues filed in the MSBuild repo in particular are of the nature of a specific customer build failed.  Those are hard for us to know how to prioritize as we don't want to miss any issue that could be affecting a larger segment of our customers while recognizing that we won't be able to help solve every customer issue. I think it's a delicate balance and we have to be very careful and deliberate with how we use such a bot.",
