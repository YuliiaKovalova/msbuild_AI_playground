I tried in different ways, like that\r\n`\r\n<Target Name=\"AfterBuild\" >  \r\n    <Exec Command=\"sh copy_plugins.sh\" />\r\n</Target>\r\n`\r\nI tried saving my project, rebuilding but it doesn't work for me. After that, I decided to try in this way to test whether Target executes anything or not\r\n`\r\n <Target Name=\"AfterBuild\" >\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Text=\"test\"/>\r\n  </Target>\r\n`\r\n`dotnet msbuild`  haven't printed anything \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53405089/102889096-ae7f6380-4462-11eb-8dba-642aa41319bb.png)\r\n(you can repro this even on a simple console app),also, build output\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53405089/102889223-eb4b5a80-4462-11eb-9a12-a7e5a79572ee.png)\r\nI think expected behavior and actual are obvious.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nThat's everything you need\r\n`\r\n <Target Name=\"AfterBuild\" >\r\n    <Message Importance=\"high\" Text=\"test\"/>\r\n  </Target>\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nmsbuild -version? 16.8.2.56705\r\nVisual Studio? 16.8.3,also tested on Visual Studio Mac,Rider,Rider on Mac\r\nTested on osx-x64,win-x64\r\n\r\n\r\n",
