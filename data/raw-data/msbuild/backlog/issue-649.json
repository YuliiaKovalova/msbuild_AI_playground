  "body": "The source code for `Tracker.exe` and `FileTracker.dll` is not open source, but those assemblies are part of the MSBuild binary distribution. We should build them internally and make them available as a package so that the built-from-GitHub version of MSBuild can include them and ship them back into Visual Studio (or other consumers). Currently tests fall back to the installed versions, which makes testing coordinated changes very difficult.\n",
