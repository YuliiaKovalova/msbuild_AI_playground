  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nRan into this problem on .NET Framework projects (old-style .csproj) when I have a single solution with multiple web projects inside the solution, where one of the projects references the other project.  Normally do command-line MSbuild call and pass in the custom publish profile like\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\MSBuild.exe\" -m mysolution.sln /t:\"webapp1\" /p:configuration=\"Release\" /p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:PublishProfile=\"webapp1 - Web Deploy.pubxml\" /p:Password=\"..omitted..\" /p:Platform=\"Any CPU\"\n\nWhen I didn't have multiple web app target in the same solution (but static .dll reference instead) this publish profile works perfectly as expected.  But now that I have multiple web projects in the same solution like:\n\n/sln/mysolution.sln\n/src/webapp1/properties/publishprofile/webapp1.pubxml\n/src/webapp2/properties/publishprofile/webapp2.pubxml\n\nAnd webapp1 directly has project reference on webapp2 (yes poor design but can't fix immediately).  What seems to happen is that even though I'm targeting webapp1 to be built, it tries to look for the publish profile in webapp2 instead.  When I do a diagnostic msbuild trace what I am seeing is something like the following.\n\n(parsing webapp1 - this appears first even though webapp2 actually has to be built first)\n...\n                   WebPublishPipelineProjectDirectory = /src/webapp1\n...\n(parsing webapp2 dependency - this appears second even though webapp2 actually has to be built first)\n...\n                   WebPublishPipelineProjectDirectory = /src/webapp2\n...\n\nEven though webapp1 depends on webapp2, so webapp2 has to be built first, the above property seems to be set in reverse order.  This results in the final value of WebPublishPipelineProjectDirectory being /src/webapp2 which informs the value for PublishProfileRootFolder to look in webapp2 for the webapp1 publish profile.  I can see that happening in the error message at the bottom:\n\n...\n                   (ValidatePublishProfileSettings target) -> \n                     C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v17.0\\Web\\Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets(4531,5): error : The value for PublishProfile is set to 'webapp1 - Web Deploy.pubxml', expected to find the file at 'C:\\...omitted...\\src\\webapp2\\Properties\\PublishProfiles\\webapp1 - Web Deploy.pubxml' but it could not be found. [omitted.csproj]\n...\n\nI had to spend a few hours reading diagnostic log and searching through .targets file because this is all poorly documented.. I guess I need to set PublishProfileRootFolder to the full path of the correct webapp publish folder to get the right profile to build?  I feel like this is a bug that it ends up looking in the wrong project for the publish profile.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Setup solution with two web projects.\n2. Have first web project set direct project reference to second web project.\n3. Put web deploy in first project publishProfile\n4. Try to build from command-line using first project publishProfile - it will fail with invalid path.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIt should always look in the target project being deployed for publish profiles, not whichever web project happened to be parsed last.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIt gets the settings for publish profile path from the last project in the dependency hierarchy that happens to be parsed for web setup, which is reverse order of build.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
