  "title": "[Broken Build]: After running `Deploy-MSBuild.ps1` for my local build, MSBuild cannot resolve a custom SDK",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nRan `build.cmd` and `Deploy-MSBuild.ps1` on main to my VS installation. When I try to build a project, getting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror : Could not resolve SDK \"Microsoft.Build.Traversal\". Exactly one of the probing messages below indicates why we could not resolve the SDK. Investigate and resolve that message to correctly specify the SDK.\r\nC:\\src\\VS\\src\\vc\\dirs.proj : error :   MSB4276: The default SDK resolver failed to resolve SDK \"Microsoft.Build.Traversal\" because directory \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Main\\MSBuild\\Sdks\\Microsoft.Build.Traversal\\Sdk\" did not exist.\r\nC:\\src\\VS\\src\\vc\\dirs.proj : error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.Build.Traversal' specified could not be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Microsoft.Build.Traversal` is a custom SDK that gets resolved from a Nuget package.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCan reach out to me on internal teams for the project I'm trying to build.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nMSBuild should be able to resolve the SDK like it was able to before patch.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nMSBuild cannot resolve the SDK.\n\n### Ask us questions\n\n_No response_",
