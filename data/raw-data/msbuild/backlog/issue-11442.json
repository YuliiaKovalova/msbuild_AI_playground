  "title": "[VS / MSBuild 17.13]: Files with build action None and CopyToOutputDirectory are no longer copied",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI updated my local visual studio from `17.12.4` to `17.13.0`. Since then my local build inside visual studio or directly using msbuild is broken. Files with build action `None` and `CopyToOutputDirectory=Always` are no longer copied to it's target path. They are simply missing. I was already able to see whats causing all this. It's a simple brace in my path. I made a sample app for this. Take a look at this:\nhttps://github.com/Mik4sa/msbuild-brace-in-path-error\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nTo reproduce open the `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` for example and execute the following command inside the cloned repo:\n`MSBuild.exe ConsoleApp2.sln -t:Build -p:Configuration=Release -v:quiet -m /restore`\n\nCheck this file for the diagnostic output of that command (in german): [diag-log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18799340/diag-log.txt)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe files should be copied to the output directory.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNo file is copied to the output directory.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAs noted above the brace `(` in the path is causing this.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n- MSBuild-Version 17.13.9+e0f243f1e f\u00fcr .NET Framework\n  17.13.9.7704\n- Windows 11 24H2 (Build 26100.3037)\n- AMD64 (x64)",
