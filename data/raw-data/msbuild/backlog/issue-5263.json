Confirm that the expression in the Import declaration \"/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.300/Current/Microsoft.Common.props\" is correct, and that the file exists on disk.  /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.300/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/Sdk/Sdk.props\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using the `16.5.0` packages. I'm setting `MSBUILD_EXE_PATH` to `/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/2.1.300/MSBuild.dll`. This path is resolved from calling `dotnet --info` in the respected project directory, and checking `Base Path: xxxxx`, to obey `global.json`.\r\n\r\nI'm sure that instead of `Current` it should look in `15.0`.\r\n",

It sounds like you're using a locally-deployed MSBuild (version 16.5) to use a .NET SDK (version 2.1.300, using MSBuild 15). That won't work very well for this and other reasons.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you shouldn't need to specify `ToolsVersion` . . . anywhere in 15.0+, as far as I know.",
