Restore error when specifying two or more target frameworks (https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4307)\r\n  `Error occurred while restoring NuGet packages: The operation failed as details for project X could not be loaded.`\r\n2. Can't override properties like OutputType in a .props file (https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/850)\r\n# Workarounds\r\nA list of things we had to work around that we can undo after bugs are fixed\r\n\r\n\r\n# Hacks\r\nHacks put in place to make progress that we should undo as we get a little further\r\n1. Using BuildTools for signing and had to set `ToolsDir` and `BuildToolsTaskDir` and import `sign.targets`.\r\n\r\n# Open Questions\r\nA list of things we need to solve to make progress.\r\n\r\n- [ ] How do we want to do signing?  Prefer not to use BuildTools anymore?\r\n- [x] How to determine if we're building .NET Framework or .NET Core during the outer build.  Only seems to be set in `.targets`.\r\n  This was solved by keying off of the property `TargetFramework` instead of `TargetFrameworkIdentifier`.  `TargetFramework` is something like `net46` so we'll need to be careful with conditions.  \r\n\r\n# Needs Investigation\r\n## Mono support \r\nNeed to determine how/if this can support Mono.\r\n\r\nRelated to #1638 and #1639.",
