  "body": "From @sbomer offline:\r\n\r\n> global properties apply to all project references, specifically in the case of \"dotnet publish /p:PublishTrimmed=true\". It causes problems because not all projects support PublishTrimmed (it's meant to be set in the app project, not in libraries).\r\n\r\nFor example, dotnet/runtime#94406.\r\n\r\nCommon targets has a special case to avoid this problem for `OutputPath`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/74f7ebbb3dd2817dede9621a00ccb343c638be2d/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L807\r\n\r\nWe could consider extending it to include `PublishTrimmed` by default, or having the SDK extend `$(_GlobalPropertiesToRemoveFromProjectReferences)`.\r\n\r\nA systemic solution could also be interesting (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9414) but this is to consider a targeted solution for this problem.",
