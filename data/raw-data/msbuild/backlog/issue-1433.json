  "title": "Sdk Package Names should be `tolower`'d",
  "body": "While merging in new templates from https://github.com/dotnet/sdk we took into CLI <Project> elements that looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\" ToolsVersion=\"15.0\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the capitalization of `NET`. The actual on-disk layout for these SDKs contain instead `Net`. This capitalization change did not cause issues on Windows as that is a case-insensitive file system but did cause issues on other platforms which are case-sensitive. The experience of tracking down this issue was frustrating because a capitalization problem in a file path is not one that immediately jumps out.\r\n\r\nGiven that NuGet already `tolower`'s package names to avoid this class of issues I think we should do the same in the `Sdk` attribute. CLI and VS will `tolower` the package name during layout generation and MSBuild will `tolower` whatever string is passed in by the user.\r\n\r\n@AndyGerlicher @srivatsn @dsplaisted @rainersigwald thoughts?\r\n\r\nNote: `NET` was actually the right casing, so we changed the on-disk layout. However, this issue is still real as anyone typing an `Sdk` value may mix up caps and end up in the same broken state.",
