  "title": "MSBuild fails on Linux/Mono with TypeLoadException",
  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\n1. Build MSBuild in the `Debug-MONO` configuration and copy it to an Ubuntu 14.04 box with Mono 3.12.1 from the official Xamarin mono-devel package.\n2. Clone https://github.com/mono/coreclr.git\n3. Run `mono {path to msbuild} {path to coreclr}/src/build.proj -nologo -p:OS=Unix`\n## Expected result\n\nSomething approximating a build\n## Actual result\n\nThe following crash occurred:\n\n```\nInvalid type Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager for instance field Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildSubmission:<BuildManager>k__BackingField\nMSBUILD : error MSB1025: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild.\nSystem.TypeLoadException: A type load exception has occurred.\n  at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.Execute (System.String commandLine) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0\nThis is an unhandled exception in MSBuild Engine -- PLEASE OPEN A BUG AGAINST THE MSBUILD TEAM.\nSystem.TypeLoadException: A type load exception has occurred.\n  at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.Execute (System.String commandLine) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0\n\nUnhandled Exception:\nSystem.TypeLoadException: A type load exception has occurred.\n  at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.Execute (System.String commandLine) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0\n[ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: System.TypeLoadException: A type load exception has occurred.\n  at Microsoft.Build.CommandLine.MSBuildApp.Execute (System.String commandLine) [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0\nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/vagrant/git/msbuild/bin/Windows_NT/Debug-MONO$\n```\n## Additional notes\n\nThrough further investigation, I discovered that the `TypeLoadException` is the result of not being able to load TPL dataflow.\n\nI was able to fix this issue by finding the dependency in `Microsoft.Build` and setting `Copy Local` to `True` in the properties pane, but I don't know if this is the _right_ solution or not.\n",

        "body": "Looks like the reason it's not copy-local if you build on Windows is because Dataflow is registered in the GAC, since VS 2015 uses that same version.  So one could argue that the \"correct\" fix here is actually to make the change described in issue #24, but making this change certainly won't harm anything. \n",
