  "body": "I have a custom MSBuild task that is contained in a NuGet package.  The build directory of the package has a target file that uses the task so the user only has to add a package reference for the MSBuild task to execute.\r\n\r\nThat part works fine.  However, package dependencies for my custom task are not being resolved.  I have been working on this for several days and cannot figure it out.  The attached file is a concise example.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[MSBuildTaskSample.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/2130872/MSBuildTaskSample.zip)\r\n",
