  "body": "### Motivation\n\nWe want to evaluate viability and benefits of using the new VS OTel collector.\nSpecifically this should help us sample and filter-out/in data that would otherwise be of a too high volume for us.\n\n### Goals\n * Prototype sending data from MSBuild (idealy those defined in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10946) via VS OTel collector (doesn't need to be mergable, can be runnable just localy with manual setup)\n * Experiment with and document the head filtering capability\n\n### Details\n* https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_wiki/wikis/DevDiv.wiki/43901/OpenTelemetry-in-VS\n* Packages:\n  * https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_artifacts/feed/VS/NuGet/Microsoft.VisualStudio.OpenTelemetry.ClientExtensions/overview/0.1.700-beta\n  *  https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_artifacts/feed/VS/NuGet/Microsoft.VisualStudio.OpenTelemetry.Collector/overview/0.1.700-beta\n",
