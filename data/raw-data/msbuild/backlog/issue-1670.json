        "body": "Hi I am the originator of this issue.\r\nAs DJDoena reported the main problem is the calculation of the macro $(WindowsSDK_ExecutablePath) using the environment macro $(PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE). I guess that the platform of the current build should be used only to lead the loader for the executable into the correct folder. I have attached my project which is a assistant generated console project modified with a task to report macros related to this issue.\r\nThis project reports me the content of $(WindowsSDK_ExecutablePath):\r\n```PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE = 'x86'\r\nPlatform = 'Win32' \r\nWindowsSDKToolArchitecture = 'Native32Bit'\r\nWindowsSDK_ExecutablePath = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.1\\bin\\x86;;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v10.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.6.1 Tools'\r\n```\r\nThis is the expected result for Win32. Now try to switch to x64 platform:\r\n```PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE = 'x86'\r\nPlatform = 'x64' \r\nWindowsSDKToolArchitecture = 'Native32Bit'\r\nWindowsSDK_ExecutablePath = 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.1\\bin\\x86;;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v10.0A\\bin\\NETFX 4.6.1 Tools'\r\n```\r\nAs we can see the result of $(WindowsSDK_ExecutablePath) is the same.\r\n@rainersigwald: Thanks for your explanation. It looks like VS uses the SysWOW64 environment running the MSBuild task.\r\n\r\n[CheckEnvVariable.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/776420/CheckEnvVariable.zip)\r\n",
