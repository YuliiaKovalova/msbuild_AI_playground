        "body": "Ok, so the core issue is that the MSBuild engine ensures that a given target is executed only once (per project per global properties). Since crosstargeting build and clean work by setting a property and then invoking the inner builds with `DispatchToInnerBuilds`, only the first (clean) inner build will execute.\r\n\r\nFor the specific case of `/t:clean;build`, we could just duplicate to have `DispatchToInnerBuildsForClean` and `DispatchToInnerBuilds`, so the former gets invoked on clean and the latter for build.\r\n\r\nI think that's actually good enough here: a user could still specify a set of inner targets as a property on the command line, and they'd get passed through the normal `DispatchToInnerBuilds`. It'd be broken if they did `/p:InnerTargets=X /t:Clean;Build` but that's broken today too.",
