  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nThe SDK resolver seems to intermittently fail when performing a graph build.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n`msbuild /graph`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nA successful build\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nIntermittently,\r\n\r\n```\r\nError : Unable to locate the .NET SDK. Check that it is installed and that the version specified in global.json (if any) matches the installed version.\r\nError MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop' specified could not be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThis error happens in an internal repo somewhat consistently. Ping me over Teams for details.\r\n\r\nNote that this happens in an Azure Pipeline and after a \"Use .NET Core\" task installs the SDK.\r\n\r\nWeirdly, this only happens with `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop` and not other SDKs. The specific project it happens with is never the same and sometimes the error doesn't happen at all.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n17.2",
