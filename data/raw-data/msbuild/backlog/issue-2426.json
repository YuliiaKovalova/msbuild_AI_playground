I definitely think we should emit this message as \"a normal message\", so it shouldn't be emitted in errors-only and warnings-only cases, or if the verbosity is set to minimal. That way it provides information in situations where there was already a lot of output, but doesn't trip people's \"detect errors by seeing if the `.err` file is non-empty\" scripting.",
