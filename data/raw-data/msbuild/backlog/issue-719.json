  "body": "Before we can be in a single branch, we need to make sure we aren't regressing full-framework MSBuild. Some of the early commits to the xplat branch were very lightly reviewed, and later reviews often didn't focus on impact to the full-framework codepaths.\n\nThis work item tracks reviewing changes between master and xplat. Each change should be handled in one of these ways:\n- **Approved**: in other words, the change seems fine and could have been applied anywhere. This includes things like conditionally-different behavior depending on host, if the behaviors are equivalent.\n- **Document .NET Core differences**: Some things just don't make sense in the .NET Core world. These should be explicitly documented so we can review them later.\n- **Fixed**: Changes that no longer make sense but are easy to repair should be fixed. Fixes should go through the normal review process.\n- **Bugged**: Changes that look wrong but don't have an easy fix should have an issue filed here on GitHub.\n\nI'll go in and file issues for each project, so we can distribute the work. I'll add those here as a checklist (because I :heart: GitHub's little progress bars).\n",
