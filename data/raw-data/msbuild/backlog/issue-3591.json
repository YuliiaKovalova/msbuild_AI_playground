  "body": "The current idiom of putting all project files in `$(MSBuildAllFiles)` has [perf implications](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/3004). Since it's used for incrementality checks, we can provide a reserved property like `MSBuildLatestProject` which avoids appending.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to [compute](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/1299) `MSBuildAllFiles`. This has complications though because the c++ sdks appends more files to it than just msbuild project files.",
