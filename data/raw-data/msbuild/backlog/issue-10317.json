  "title": "Ensure lifetime of BuildCheckManager",
  "body": "### Context\n\n`BuildCheckManager` is currently created once per node and survives for the entire lifetime of the node. This might be problematic as it contains state that should not be shared between builds - BuildChecks registration, ConfigurationModule, etc.\n\n### Possible solution\n\n`BuildRequestEngine` contains `InitializeForBuild` and `CleanupForBuild` methods that anchor a single build. `CleanupForBuild` is already used to finalize the BuildCheckManager stats collection. We can add caches invalidation (if needed in the future - not now).\n\nThe `InitializeForBuild` should probably contain code ensuring that `BuildCheckManager` is recreated or reinitialized.\n\n### Alternative solution\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10009 will eventually contain solution for making `BuildCheckManager` instance based and probably owned by `LoggingContext` - so lifetime might not be of a concern anymore... but we are not there yet\n\n\n**BLOCKED BY** https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10145",
