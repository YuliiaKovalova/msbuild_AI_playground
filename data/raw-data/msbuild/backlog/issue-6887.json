  "body": "### Discussed in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/discussions/6871\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **jhennessey** September 20, 2021</sup>\r\nI'm trying to make use of the new [ProjectReference SetPlatform Negotiation](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/ProjectReference-Protocol.md#setplatform-negotiation) feature. After performing all of the documented steps to enable the feature, I could not get a simplistic two project (non-SDK style) build to work correctly. In this case, **NetFx.Library2** (x86/x64) referenced **NetFx.Library1** (AnyCPU). When attempting to build, it would result with the following error:\r\n\r\n`(_CheckForInvalidConfigurationAndPlatform target) ->\r\n  c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Preview\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(820\r\n,5): error : The BaseOutputPath/OutputPath property is not set for project 'NetFx.Library1.csproj'.  Please check to ma\r\nke sure that you have specified a valid combination of Configuration and Platform for this project.  Configuration='Debug'  Platform='x64'.  You may be seeing this message because you are trying to build a project without a solution file,\r\n and have specified a non-default Configuration or Platform that doesn't exist for this project.`\r\n \r\nAfter exploring the logs and associated code changes for the feature, I could see that `PlatformTarget` was being passed to the referenced project [here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/c5eef1eb28e4e3984fd41be6f25f410f698dc126/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L1678). That doesn't appease the referenced project because it uses `Platform` for its defined configurations. **However**, if I change the referenced code to pass `Platform` (along with `PlatformTarget`) my build works as expected.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason why `Platform` can't also be passed to the referenced projects?\r\n\r\n#5338 \r\n#6655\r\n\r\nLogs:\r\n[error.log](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/7197630/error.log)\r\n[success.log](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/7197631/success.log)\r\n </div>\r\n\r\n### Summarized\r\nThe long and the short of it: We should be passing `Platform=` instead of `PlatformTarget=`. There also needs to be an investigation as to whether or not we need to remove the use of `PlatformTarget` within the feature.",
