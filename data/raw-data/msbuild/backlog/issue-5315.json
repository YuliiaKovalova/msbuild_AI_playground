A 130 MB binlog contains 33,524 of these, totalling 23,573,872 chars.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking when dumping this particular message we should shorten items to say a 1,000 characters? Not sure if there is a situation where we need to have these in full, but they'll be recoverable from the surrounding log context if really necessary. Maybe just take the first two items,  concatenate and then truncate to 1,000 chars?\r\n\r\nI'm sure the current behavior also results in tons of memory allocations and traffic across nodes.",
