  "body": "### Context\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8917 introduced built-in build event args classes for most commonly custom-subclassed build event args types. The `CriticalBuildMessageEventArgs` was ommited, while there is possible need for that.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\nIn a same idea as https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8917 add support for using `CriticalBuildMessageEventArgs` with a custom data. The naming is up for implementer decision (need to weight in balance between descriptiveness and easy 'human-discoverability'). ",
