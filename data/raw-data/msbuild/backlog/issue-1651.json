  "body": "`Microsoft.Build.Engine` (\"OrcasEngine\") and `Microsoft.Build.Conversion` have been deprecated compat-shim layers for many releases (\"Orcas\" was a codename for Visual Studio 2008, so they've been deprecated since ~2010), but they haven't been marked as such. We should mark everything as obsolete for v16 so that we can just delete all of that code for v17.",
