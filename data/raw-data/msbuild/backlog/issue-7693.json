  "title": "Support disabling node reuse with an msbuild property",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nWhen developing tasks and testing those in the same solution, msbuild reused nodes lock the output of file in the original task's project output location.\r\n\r\nThe only known way to avoid this is to have `/nr:false`, but doing so from visual studio does not seem possible.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have an msbuild property to disable the node reuse for the \"current\" node (whatever it means for the msbuild runtime) so the files get unlocked at the end?\r\n\r\nThe issue is similar to https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/5385\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following as possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n\r\nIf providing steps to reproduce the issue proves difficult, consider attaching a binlog:\r\n[Details on sharing binary logs](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog)\r\n[More information on binary logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md)\r\nNOTE: Binary logs capture environment information. Ensure it does not include any information you don't want to be public before you attach one.\r\nIf you want to share one just with Microsoft, you can [report a problem through Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report) and share it privately with Microsoft.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n17.3 Preview 1\r\n",
