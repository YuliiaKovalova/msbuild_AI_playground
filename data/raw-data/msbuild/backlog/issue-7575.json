All rights reserved.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there some meaning to this copyright line? Or can it be omitted?\r\n\r\nInstead of `Microsoft (R) Build Engine <version>` maybe we can use `MSBuild <version>` and remove the _registered trademark Microsoft_ bit?\r\n\r\ncc @omajid @richlander @rainersigwald @Forgind ",
