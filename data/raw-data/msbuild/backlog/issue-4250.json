  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm playing a bit with clang in VS 2019 RC (MSBuild 16.0.450) using android targets as well as my own toolchain stuff. I was trying recent clang versions (6,7,9) but noticed that the file tracker is only working with clang up to version 5. When using newer versions the tracker 'write' file has no contents (resulting in missing up-to-date checks). Anyone knows if this can be fixed on the clang side or is it a file tracker issue ? \r\n\r\nThanks.",
