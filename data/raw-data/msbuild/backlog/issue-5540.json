  "body": "Today, you can specify that tasks should run in a TaskHost of the appropriate bitness/architecture, which will move execution into the correct environment. However, the MSBuild scheduler node will still load the task assembly to extract information about the task. But that can fail if the task assembly isn't AnyCPU or the currently-running architecture.\r\n\r\nI think we could use `System.Reflection.Metadata` to extract task information instead, and defer the load to the process of the right arch/runtime.\r\n\r\nThis may be more relevant when we have #711 or #4834.",
