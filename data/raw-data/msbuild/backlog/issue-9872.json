  "title": "[Bug]: warning MSB8064 in Visual Studio 2022 Community using cmake's FetchContent_Declare",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhen I run my cmake project that uses cmake's FetchContent_Declare to download and configure boost libraries with Visual Studio 2019 everything works fine, but when trying to compile with Visual Studio Community 2022, I receive warning messages in random boost libraries from the script like so:\r\n\r\n> C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VC\\v170\\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(254,5): warning MSB8064: Custom build for item \"D:\\projects\\...\\boostassert-subbuild\\CMakeFiles\\fadc7e32d087e98c59c0cb2287341fc9\\boostassert-populate-test.rule\" succeeded, but specified dependency \"d:\\projects\\...\\boostassert-subbuild\\boostassert-populate-prefix\\src\\boostassert-populate-stamp\\debug\\boostassert-populate-install\" does not exist. This may cause incremental build to work incorrectly. [D:\\projects\\...\\boostassert-subbuild\\boostassert-populate.vcxproj]\r\n\r\nAnd then cmake fails to find those libraries and shows messages like this one:\r\n\r\n> CMake Error at build/_deps/boosttest-src/CMakeLists.txt:41 (target_link_libraries):\r\n  Target \"boost_prg_exec_monitor\" links to:\r\n\r\n>    Boost::io\r\n\r\n> but the target was not found.  Possible reasons include:\r\n\r\n>  * There is a typo in the target name.\r\n>  * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.\r\n>   * An ALIAS target is missing.\r\n\r\n> Call Stack (most recent call first):\r\n> build/_deps/boosttest-src/CMakeLists.txt:57 (boost_test_add_library)\r\n\r\nI have to run the configuration step two or three more times to download the libraries properly.\r\n> cmake -S . -B build\r\n\r\nI strongly believe this is a MSBuild's bug\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nHere is the script used: https://pastecode.io/s/0pb1021t\r\nCMake version is 3.28.3\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nDownload the libraries at first run\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDescribed in the issue's description\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
