  "title": "[Bug]: Check for determining \"project file\" does not correctly work for solution filter files",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhen running `dotnet build` in a folder which only contains a `.slnf` the commands won't work because no valid \"project file\" can be determined, but if you run `dotnet build MyFilter.slnf` the commands correctly work.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCreate a solution with the following structure and run `dotnet build` in the folder `ServiceA`\r\n\r\n```\r\n/\r\n\u251c\u2500 ServiceA/\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 ServiceA.QueryHandling/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 ServiceA.QueryHandling.csproj\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 ServiceA.slnf\r\n\u251c\u2500 MySolution.sln\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe build should correctly pick up the solution filter file and work like it would in the `/` and `ServiceA.QueryHandling` folders.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIf you run it in the `ServiceA` folder you get this error:\r\n`MSB1003: Specify a project or solution file. The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file.`\r\n\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nI think the problem is on line 3422 here that it only looks for `*.sln` files and therefore never picks up `*.slnf` files, so it should probably be changed to `*.sln*` to actually correctly pick up the solution filter files.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/5d663a0cbe85b5b4e70c3a07068e96cfaa5c6a70/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L3422-L3497\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild version 17.8.3+195e7f5a3 for .NET\r\n17.8.3.51904%\r\n\r\ndotnet 8.0.100\r\n\r\nmacOS 14.2.1 (23C71)",
