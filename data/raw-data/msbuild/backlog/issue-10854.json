  "body": "### Context\n\nOriginaly reported here: https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/issues/3856\nThere is a conflict of 2 versions of `Microsoft.Win32.Registry` reported by RAR. One of the conflicting versions is brought by the test platform as a development only dependency (more details: https://github.com/microsoft/testfx/issues/3856#issuecomment-2367790608) - so the RAR report seems a s false positive.\n\n### Goals\n\n - Investigate the source of those 2 conflicting dependencies\n - Find out if both should be considered by RAR, or whether any of those should have been ignored",
