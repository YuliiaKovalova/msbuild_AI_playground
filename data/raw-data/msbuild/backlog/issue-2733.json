  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nGoing by directions here:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild\r\nI verified my Mac OSX (10.12.6) has OpenSSL (0.9.8zh), and Mono (5.4.1.6). I downloaded and unzipped msbuild-master.zip. In Terminal, I cd to Downloads/msbuild-master and run this command:\r\n```\r\n./cibuild.sh --target Mono\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of the command is this:\r\n```\r\nERROR: Could not restore build tools correctly. See '/Users/macserver/Downloads/msbuild-master/init-tools.log' for more details.1\r\nInitializing BuildTools...\r\n/Users/macserver/Downloads/msbuild-master/init-tools.sh: line 122: /Users/macserver/Downloads/msbuild-master/packages/Microsoft.DotNet.BuildTools/1.0.27-prerelease-00927-05/lib/init-tools.sh: No such file or directory\r\nERROR: An error occured when trying to initialize the tools. Please check '/Users/macserver/Downloads/msbuild-master/init-tools.log' for more details.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAttached is the full log of the command as well as init-tools.log:\r\n[init-tools.log](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1489191/init-tools.log)\r\n[log1.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1489192/log1.txt)\r\n\r\nI've tried deleting the msbuild-master directory, then unzipping it again and copying init-tools.sh from `msbuild-master/packages/msbuild/` to `msbuild-master/packages/Microsoft.DotNet.BuildTools/1.0.27-prerelease-00927-05/lib/`, but that just led to a rabbit hole of other errors.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n```./cibuild.sh --target Mono``` succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n```./cibuild.sh --target Mono``` fails.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\nOS info:\r\nMac OSX (10.12.6) has OpenSSL (0.9.8zh), and Mono (5.4.1.6)\r\n",
