  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nI try to update my directory.build.props file to conditionally include a resources.resx when its available, but that doesn't seem to work. I don't know if this is a bug or by design.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nAdd the following section to your directory.build.props file\r\n\r\n```\r\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\"Exists('./Properties/Resources.resx')\">\r\n    <Compile Update=\"Properties\\Resources.Designer.cs\" DesignTime=\"True\" AutoGen=\"True\" DependentUpon=\"Resources.resx\" />\r\n    <EmbeddedResource Update=\"Properties\\Resources.resx\" Generator=\"ResXFileCodeGenerator\" LastGenOutput=\"Resources.Designer.cs\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nResources.designer.cs file is updated when resource file changes\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nResource designer file doesn't change when resx file changes.\r\n",
