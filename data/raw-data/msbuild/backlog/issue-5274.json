  "body": "A particular interest of mine is more automation (and thus less to worry about). With that in mind I'd like to create a single issue tracking areas of MSBuild we can automate. \r\n\r\nHere's a list of things that have and can _potentially_ be automated. regardless of the size of the task.\r\n\r\n- [x] Maestro 16.x -> master automated PRs. See https://github.com/dotnet/versions/pull/557\r\n- [x] Fully automated releases.\r\n- [x] Automated experimental branch builds. See https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/pull/4897\r\n- [ ] Automate xsd insertions. See https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/5533\r\n- [ ] Branding updates\r\n- [ ] Darc channel creation / updates\r\n- [ ] Switching major version numbers (16.6 -> 16.7) in our release definition. See https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/4929\r\n- [ ] Loc Checkin Merges?\r\n- [ ] Improved documentation flow for new features\r\n\r\n/cc @rainersigwald @Forgind Please comment or edit this issue with other items. I'd like to come back to this during calmer periods.",

        "body": "I think all but the loc checkins would be tough to fully automate, but it would be nice to make this smoother/more efficient. Branding updates are hard, for instance, because of LTS releases. If we had a file with a list of which versions are LTS and assume normal for the rest, we'd only have to update it once per LTS release.",
