  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nHave a VB.Net winforms project using SDK project type. The project should include two forms with the same name in separate namespaces. Each form should have its icon set, so that it creates a resource file.\r\n\r\nThis isn't an issue for C#.\r\n\r\n**See Attached zip:**\r\nVB: [TestApp2.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/files/4843881/TestApp2.zip)\r\nC#: [TestApp3.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/files/4855050/TestApp3.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Error:**\r\n```\r\nMSB3577: Two output file names resolved to the same output path: \"obj\\Debug\\net472\\TestApp2.Edit.resources\"\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code that the error points you to is line 3036 in Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets  which is situated in the CoreResGen section:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/e2a33003170b038bf0c2414df166b5409d4b9581/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L3035-L3064\r\n\r\nI believe the error is raised from:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/86d9494e446de002ea6a4f08d6fbd111b1041059/src/Tasks/GenerateResource.cs#L1462-L1491\r\n\r\nThe issue stems from the fact that in VB.Net the OutputResources are added without their namespaces:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2433737/86191318-1460f180-bb8a-11ea-85cb-1095f9092aa4.png)\r\n\r\nWhere as the C# OutputResources are fully qualified:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2433737/86191418-59852380-bb8a-11ea-8b17-80a2768aa850.png)\r\n\r\nThe names are transformed here using the EmbeddedResources ManifestResourceName, which seems to be broken in VB.NET:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/e2a33003170b038bf0c2414df166b5409d4b9581/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L3050\r\n",

Especially after discovering that vb.net doesn't account for subfolders _by design_. The way DependentUpon works at the moment is also _by design_, and this specific situation is an unfortunate side effect that we offer ways to get around (manually setting `LogicalName`, `ManifestResourceName` metadata, or changing the folder structure).\r\n\r\nThough I do agree we should clarify the differences between the two files, as this info should be archived. If you'd like, please file an issue \ud83d\ude42 otherwise I can do that in a day or two.\r\n",

But maybe in visual studio, to lighten the load of management.\r\n\r\nI spent the last 4 days working to convert to an SDK project for two production winforms applications. I have to manually added entries for every form for the compile(vb/designer.vb) and embeddedresource tags(.resx) to get it to work.\r\n\r\nWill visual studio be managing these entries in the project file in the future for VB.Net projects? \r\n\r\nsome of the issues I have had:\r\n- licx files (the release build didn't have a license for 3rd party component)\r\n- version numbers not showing in users app data folder, but on the assembly. (I had to use the version tag, instead of AssemblyVersion and FileVersion)\r\n- forms not showing as a form and being unable to be edited. (fix was manual entries, sometimes it wasn't needed, I can't work out what breaks it.)\r\n\r\nIt really does need someone to investigate the use case thoroughly to iron out issues with the sdk format.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your help.
