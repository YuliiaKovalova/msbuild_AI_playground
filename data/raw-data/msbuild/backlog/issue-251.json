  "title": "Cross-platform solution for default encoding",
  "body": "The unit test `ExecTaskUnicodeCharacterInCommand` passes on full-framework master but fails in xplat, because the default encoding isn't available on CoreCLR.  We should fix that, and there are good ideas as to how in #246.  For now I'm going to disable the test since I'm more focused on getting failures to zero than on fixing things, and there's an easy workaround for this: don't build on paths with non-ASCII characters in them.\n",
