  "title": "[Performance]: AccelerateBuildsInVisualStudio Breaks FUTDC for Non-SDK Projects",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nSetting AccelerateBuildsInVisualStudio to true causes the FUTDC to think that non-SDK projects aren't up to date, which breaks incremental builds. My company has some larger non-SDK web apps that we can't change to SDK-style and it's hurting our build performance.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n[WebApplication_NonSDK.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17496918/WebApplication_NonSDK.zip)\n\nI attached a very small project with AccelerateBuildsInVisualStudio set to true. Notice that the project will continually build with no changes made between builds. Removing the property fixes the issue.\n\nThere is also a workaround by adding this condition: Condition=\"'$(UsingMicrosoftNETSdk)' == 'true'\" \nBut not all developers may notice this or catch this. Would be nice to have that check included in the code for the property.\n\n### Data\n\nIncremental build (2nd time building w/ no changes after 1st build) takes 0.196s with AccelerateBuildsInVisualStudio set to true.\n\nIncremental build takes 0.045s after removing AccelerateBuildsInVisualStudio.\n\nIn my company's codebase, we have 4 major non-SDK web apps that have this issue and it causes a performance degradation of about 30 seconds on our incremental builds.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_\n\n### Regression\n\n- [ ] yes\n- [x] no\n\n### Regression Details\n\n_No response_",
