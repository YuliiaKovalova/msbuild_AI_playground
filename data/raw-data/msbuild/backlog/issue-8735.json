  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI'm not sure if this is an msbuild issue or an issue with GitHub Actions OSX agents. The problem is unique to OSX though.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the following GitHub Actions run, all 3 jobs experienced the same build errors (which were warnings-as-errors, BTW), but only Windows and Ubuntu reported failure. The Mac OSX agent went on and reported overall success, defeating the point of my setting `MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors` to `true` as an environment variable.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.Cryptocurrencies/actions/runs/4905363640/jobs/8759094126?pr=5\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.Cryptocurrencies\r\ncd Nerdbank.Cryptocurrencies\r\ngit checkout 52b604bdd0ed2239ca491118ee7a886ab60963d1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen push this commit to some branch and run github actions on your fork and observe the results.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expect all jobs to fail.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe OSX job reports success, despite its own build log reporting several errors.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

Repro this locally both on window and mac. haven't try it on Linux. But not sure why this is only repro on GitHub Actions OSX. \r\nRepro steps locally: \r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.Cryptocurrencies\r\ncd Nerdbank.Cryptocurrencies\r\ngit checkout 52b604bdd0ed2239ca491118ee7a886ab60963d1\r\nmsbuild /p:MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors=true /t:rebuild\r\n```\r\nwhen build with `msbuild /p:MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors=true /t:rebuild /m:1`, It build failed as expected all the time. But with multiple CPU counts greater than 2, the issues will repro.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/26814373/69103438-e926-4135-ae53-08afc01eebd0)",

        "body": "It looks like specifying `-warnaserror` on the command line works correctly on macOS. That's generally preferable to setting the property via environment variable for CI scenarios (since it works for all categories of warning and doesn't hit https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4038).\r\n\r\nHowever, what you're doing should work and it's very confusing that it is wrong only on macOS. We should drill into that.",

It seems to be a race condition in build manager from long time ago, @rokonec soon will make a fix for it. Just recently the probability of it was increased and we started to see it more. Note, if you use .NET Core version of msbuild (\"dotnet build\" command instead of \"msbuild\"), the bug often goes away. This might work as a temporary workaround.\r\n\r\nEasy repro steps:\r\n1. Create a new console application.\r\n2. Add a class library as a second project to the solution.\r\n3. Make class library to throw a warning (add unused variable for example)\r\n4. Build with `msbuild /p:MSBuildTreatWarningsAsErrors=true /t:rebuild /m:2`",
