So there is a clear ROI.\n\nOne way of achieving those goals is via redesigns (evaluation caching; moving from x-process parallelisation to in-process parallelisation; extracting long lived stateful caches - msbuild server; RAR service ...) - all those are tracked separately.\n\nIn this epic we want to focus on isolated targeted improvements via a \"measure - analyse - improve\" loop.\n\n### Docs\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11048\n* https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/11002",
