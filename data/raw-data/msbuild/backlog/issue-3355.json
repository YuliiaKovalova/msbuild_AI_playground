  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate any .NET Core project (eg., with `dotnet new console`)\r\nBuild it (eg., with `dotnet build` or `msbuild /t:restore;build`)\r\nRun it with msbuild (ie., `msbuild /t:run`)\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nIt runs similar to doing `dotnet run` or `dotnet exec`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Preview\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\15.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1056,5): error : Cannot run '....\\xyz.dll' because project output type is not '.exe' [...\\xyz.csproj]`\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output: 15.8.52.54110\r\n\r\nOS info: Win 10\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n```\r\n>dotnet --version\r\n2.1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure many people know about the `run` target so perhaps this isn't a big deal - but ideally something in the .NET Core SDK targets would override it to make it work.\r\n\r\ncc @livarcocc",
