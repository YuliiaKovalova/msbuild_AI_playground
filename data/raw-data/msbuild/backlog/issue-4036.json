  "body": "The only use case of /interactive is to work with nuget for auth. So `/interactive` is not useable today.\r\n\r\nRepo step\r\n1. Create an project reference a private nuget feed. And run \"installcredprovider.sh\".\r\n2. `dotnet msbuild /t:build /restore /interactive` does not invoke auth extension while `dotnet msbuild /t:build /restore /p:NuGetInteractive=true` do\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/3697 we plan to create a new option `/interactive` to replace `NuGetInteractive`. However, from my understanding, nuget should detect `MSBuildInteractive` instead of [directly looking into](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/e1656fa697cb189b342c1fe509eebb16d90e9817/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Build.Tasks/NuGet.targets#L125) `NuGetInteractive`.\r\n \r\nWe need discussion. Either msbuild also set NuGetInteractive at the same time when /interactive is used or nuget should read `MSBuildInteractive` instead.",
