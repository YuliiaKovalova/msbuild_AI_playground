        "body": "Ok, I think I figured out what I actually need. In the .NET SDK for OSX is the `dotnet` command which takes `msbuild` as an argument. If I understand things correctly, to build a project one must execute `dotnet msbuild` which is a bit different from Windows, but very workable. Thank you!",
