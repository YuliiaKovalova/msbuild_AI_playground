  "title": "msbuild should output \"why built\" or \"why out-of-date\" messages at Normal verbosity",
  "body": "Currently, to get msbuild to output messages explaining why targets are out of date and why a project needed to build requires the user to set log verbosity to the highest level:  diagnostic.\r\n\r\nThis is frequently the only reason one needs to turn on diagnostic verbosity.  I would suggest promoting 'why out-of-date' messages to Normal verbosity.  At the very least Detailed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3>------ Up-To-Date check: Project: corebuild_buildlayers_tests, Configuration: Debug x64 ------\r\n3>Project is not up-to-date: build input 'c:\\repos\\corebuild\\buildtools\\src\\corebuild\\dbb\\buildlayers\\tests\\testdata\\fullbuildlayers.json' was modified after the last build finished.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI turned on diagnostic mode so that I could see the latter of these two lines.  However, diagnostic logging added 24940 other lines to the output.  In normal mode, 25 lines are logged.  In minimal mode, 2 lines.  So in order to see that one additional \"not up-to-date\" line on top of normal mode, I had to increase verbosity by 1000x.  By default I'm in Minimal mode, in which case that one additional line require scaling up by 12000x.\r\n\r\n\"Why did this project build\" is probably the single most important thing to know about the project, after the result.  As such, it can even be argued that it's important enough for Minimal mode.  Maybe it deserves an orthogonal setting of its own.",

        "body": "Unfortunately default msbuild command line verbosity is `normal` since the start. In my opinion this was a mistake and should have been `minimal` by default. When I type just `msbuild` I just want a build to happen, I don't need to see command lines, etc, just an indication of each project as it completes and perhaps where the output went. If the up to date messages appear in normal verbosity, the output of typing `msbuild` gets even more verbose.",

        "body": "Normal mode may very well be too noisy, I won't refute that.  The only mitigation available is to switch it down to a lower mode.  What I will argue is that \"out of date\" messages are more important than virtually every other message already added in Normal, relative to Minimal.\r\n\r\nExplaining \"why built\" ubiquitously (e.g. in Normal) is the only way to empower the team to keep its average incremental build times to a minimum.  It also has the positive side-effect of reinforcing the developer's understanding of the build graph.  Without that help--if one has to enable diagnostic mode to see the feedback--an incremental build will inevitably spiral out of control and require someone to spend some time fixing it back up, with productivity quietly suffering in the meantime.  I've seen it a hundred times.\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to satisfy everyone with a single set of verbosity rules.  Perhaps the best approach would be for messages to be more a al carte, and for the default message selection to be a property of a solution.  That way project maintainers could be in charge of what project contributors see--and therefore focus on--by default.\r\n ",
