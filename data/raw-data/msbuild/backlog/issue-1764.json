Because of that, the `Predecessor` value is null (and the test passes), and the `m` metadata is set to `2;` because the metadatum reference `%(m)` is replaced with the empty string.\r\n\r\nBut when adding the missing `'`, the test starts failing, because all of a sudden `%(m)` has a value.\r\n\r\nThe current real behavior makes sense to me but before fixing the test to expect it, I'd like to make sure we've investigated why the test expects different.",
