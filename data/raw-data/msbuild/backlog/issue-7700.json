Personally, I am not a graphic designer, but I would like to see a logo in a modern flat style (maybe in a color similar to the .NET Foundation logo).",

I based my version off of the low res version contained in msbuild.exe; the embedded icon maxes out at 32x32. However, someone could add my 256x256 version (and maybe even a downscaled 128x, 64x, and 48x, for good measure).\r\n\r\n> Making it an SVG would be a nice addition and enable displaying the icon in more resolutions.\r\n\r\nYou mean in this repo?
