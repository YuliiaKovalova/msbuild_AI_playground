  "title": "Add setup documentation when Mono is built from source",
  "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nWhen building mono from source msbuild isn't included by default. When trying to add msbuild after mono is already built the bootstrapping fails. Perhaps it is the lack of documentation about [building, testing, and debugging](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild) on other platforms, but everything I've come across in discussion forums about this seem to indicate it is broken. @borgdylan seems to be the only person to have successfully done it and it wasn't without issue.\r\n\r\nAny guidance, advice, or fixes are very welcome! Thanks in advance!",
