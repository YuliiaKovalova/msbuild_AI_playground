  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nWhen launching the `build.cmd` (no matter if in *cmd.exe* or *PowerShell*) the font used for the console is changed to default used by *powershell* script.\r\nAs an example, having *consolas* font with size 14 selected:\r\n![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70535775/96899117-cfdac800-1490-11eb-9072-9232da245269.png)\r\nit's changed to:\r\n![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70535775/96898615-37dcde80-1490-11eb-8af4-a86298876851.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** due to Polish language selected by *build.cmd* I also have some errors in displaying words containing special characters (notice for example \"*okre lanie*\" and \"*przywr\u00f3cenia*\"). Some are displayed incorrectly, some are just avoided.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n* Configure your console with custom font family and font size settings\r\n* Go to MSBuild project repository directory\r\n* Launch the *build.cmd* and observe the change\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nConsole settings and font's style is kept and any output from *build.cmd* is printed with the customized settings and font.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nSettings are changed and stay changed even after *build.cmd* exits.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nIt looks like a problem with encoding, as [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/1548564) says.\r\nThe solution given in the mentioned answered solves the problem, but also forces the language to be english - it doesn't bother me, but if we want to keep the ability of *build.cmd* script to be displayed in various languages, then it's still needed to figure out better solution.\r\n",

So I'm not sure there's anything we can do to implement a fix.\r\n\r\nDoes the same thing happen if you use the new [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)?\r\n\r\nDoes the same thing happen if you `chcp 65001` instead of `437`?
