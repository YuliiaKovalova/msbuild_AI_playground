Can we `sudo brew install` it ourselves as part of the build, or is there a more official way to get mono installed on everything?\r\n\r\nA fallback plan would be for our build process to setup an app-local installation of mono (just unzipping stuff and moving it around). @radical how easy is it to do this?",
