  "body": "Currently it seems that we're publishing the .pdb files inside the `lib\\net46` folder of NuGet packages for MSBuild (e.g. https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build). However those .pdbs don't seem to be SourceLinked (i.e. they don't point to sources on GitHub). They also seem to be classic (not portable) pdbs.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if these .pdbs were source linked, i.e. mapped to the exact source of the commit on GitHub.\r\n\r\ncc @tmat",

The toolset has support for such process and it's easy to do. \r\n\r\nFirst, I'd recommend converting your VSTS build definitions to YAML format. See e.g. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/.vsts-ci.yml. That makes it much easier to make the necessary changes to symbol publishing.\r\n",
