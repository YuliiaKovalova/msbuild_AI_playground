Looking over what the test does:\r\n- it constructs a graph\r\n- uses that graph and some other test inputs to generate a solution file\r\n- it constructs a graph based on the generated solution file and asserts some properties\r\n\r\nThe most hang risky places in all of this seems to be the parallel graph construction, given the amount of synchronization in ParallelWorkSet.\r\n\r\nBut I have no concrete leads. It would be awesome if there was a way to capture a process dump on a hanged test, so we can look at the callstacks",
