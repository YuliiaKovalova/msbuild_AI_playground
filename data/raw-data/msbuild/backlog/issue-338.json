Ideally, if MSDN is modular enough, we can replace the MSDN MSBuild documentation with a git repo that merges and cherry picks commits from the potential MSBuild GH documentation repo\n   2. If MSDN is closed to contribution, then the MSBuild GH documentation repo could become the official one and MSDN becomes a historical reference\n   3. Format wise, depending on how the MSDN docs are kept on the server, we might have to write a quick adapter between the two. Or if the internal MSDN documentation format uses a public standard (wiki, markdown, etc) we can have that format be the public format as well (however this will be out of sync with the CoreCLR .rst format)\n",
