  "body": "When building a project that targets the 2.0/3.0/3.5 Framework we try to use the tools defined by the `$(SDK35ToolsPath)` property:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/d42d3504057ef2b88dd4f68c4bfc5591371bd6fe/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NETFramework.CurrentVersion.props#L85 \r\n\r\nwhich we read from the registry. However, if the 3.5 development tools aren't installed then we won't find the value in the registry, `$(SDK35ToolsPath)` will not be defined, and we will silently \"upgrade\" to the 4.x tools instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/d42d3504057ef2b88dd4f68c4bfc5591371bd6fe/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NETFramework.CurrentVersion.props#L90\r\n\r\nThis can cause problems, such as [using the wrong version of tlbimp to generate interop assemblies](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/571032/target-framework-is-ignored-when-generating-intero.html) (which subsequently won't load at runtime).\r\n\r\nWe should instead detect and warn the user (or maybe even emit an error) when the 3.5 tools aren't installed.",

In this case, hopefully few people target 3.5, but those people are increasingly likely to not have 3.5 installed on their new machine. I think it's probably worth adding the error.",
