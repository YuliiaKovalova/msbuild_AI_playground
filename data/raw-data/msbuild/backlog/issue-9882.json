  "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nThis issue tracks one of the BuildCheck analyzers we would like to ship in-box with MSBuild.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nImplement an analyzer with the following rule: `EmbeddedResource` items should not be defined without the `Culture` metadatum.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nWhen `Culture` is missing, the culture is inferred from the file name. This is using the culture-name mapping of the currently running .NET runtime, which hurts build reproducibility.",
