Ideally we'd have a Roslyn analyzer (or something) that would ban them (from both the task and ideally the closure of things it calls).\n\n### Things to just error on\n\n* `Debug.Fail` and `Environment.FailFast` (kills worker node without giving time to report the error)\n\n### Things we'd need to have a replacement for\n\n* Current working directory\n* environment\n* File I/O (because of implicit CWD, but this is hard to balance)",
