  "body": "Working on a build change this morning and got the following error (typical of large build changes):\n\n```\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\14.0\\bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(1820,5): warning MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions of the sam e dependent assembly that could not be resolved.  These reference conflicts are listed in the build log when log verbosity is set to detailed. [some project name]\n```\n\nThis is a frustrating error because the solution and reference sets are very large.  I can't just glance at the project and know what the problem is.  Using a detailed output build takes a considerable amount of time to complete (plenty in fact to write this issue report).  \n\nCan we change this warning to include the DLL for which there is an issue?  Would make it so much easier to track down the problem. \n",
