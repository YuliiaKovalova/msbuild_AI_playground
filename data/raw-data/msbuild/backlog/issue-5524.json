  "body": "We have a project structure that generates C# code from json in a PostBuild event. It works in VS, but it does not from the `dotnet build` command.\r\n\r\nHere is the (simplified) build order\r\n1. Generator\r\n2. Server\r\n    - PostBuild: runs the Generator project which inserts cs files into the Model project below\r\n3. Model (builds generated cs files)\r\n4. Consumer (project uses code from Model project)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the first time it's built it fails because Consumer can't find the classes generated in the Model project. But the build logs clearly show the Server project's build (and PostBuild) completing before the Model project's build, and the Model project's build completing before the Consumer build runs.\r\n\r\nThe second time the build is run, it works, indicating that either the Consumer is not seeing the new Model, or when the Model project is built, it's not building the generated files.\r\n\r\nFrom Visual Studio it works every time the first time (running a repo git clean in-between to delete all generated files).\r\n",
