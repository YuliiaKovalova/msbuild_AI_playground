This looks wrong - it doesn't using the encoding coming from the file, in this case UTF-8 (no BOM). \r\n\r\nLook at the XML specification for what to do in case where the encoding is not specified in the XML declaration: https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-guessing. Hint, StreamReader will already do the right think here - so just read the encoding it sniff'd.",
