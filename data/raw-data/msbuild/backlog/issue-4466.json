  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nTrying to migrate our builds to use 2019 (16.1.3) tooling, however the only way i can get them to compile is to run them via cmd.exe. \r\n\r\nWhen i start developer command prompt 2019 (16.1.76+g14b0a930a7 for .NET Framework) it fails to link some of my c++ dlls\r\n \"d:\\prod\\structures\\Core\\Reinforcement\\ReinforcementTests\\ReinforcementTests.vcxproj\" (default target) (188) ->\r\n       (Link target) ->\r\n         polymesh_face_test.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol \"public: static class std::shared_ptr<class\r\n        rbrPolymeshFace_c> __cdecl rbrPolymeshFace_c::CreateFace(struct Id_c const &,class std::shared_ptr<class rbrReb\r\n       arSetAggregate_c> const &,int,double,class geometry::Polymesh_c const &)\" (?CreateFace@rbrPolymeshFace_c@@SA?AV?\r\n       $shared_ptr@VrbrPolymeshFace_c@@@std@@AEBUId_c@@AEBV?$shared_ptr@VrbrRebarSetAggregate_c@@@3@HNAEBVPolymesh_c@ge\r\n       ometry@@@Z) referenced in function \"private: virtual void __cdecl REBAR_rbrPolymeshFaceTest_IntersectPlaneWithCy\r\n       linder1_Test::TestBody(void)\" (?TestBody@REBAR_rbrPolymeshFaceTest_IntersectPlaneWithCylinder1_Test@@EEAAXXZ) [d\r\n       :\\prod\\structures\\Core\\Reinforcement\\ReinforcementTests\\ReinforcementTests.vcxproj]\r\n\r\nMy guess, is that the windows sdk is somehow messed up, and not using the 8.1 that i have centrally defined for all projects. \r\n\r\nI tried several things, having vs 2017 and vs 2019 installed, vs 2019 only. Run those in build farm. Eveyrhting works except in developer and c++ native command prompt. Also VS enterpresie or Professional results in same issue\r\n\r\nSeems some kind of regression in 2019.\r\n\r\nPS: this is a v141 compiler, centrally configured for all projects.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "@jmecosta Thanks for filling this issue, however, this is not the best place to file c++ issues.\r\n\r\nCould you instead file a vs feedback ticket through VS itself. It will make its way to the vc++ team quicker and you will get a more timely response to your issue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I am going to close this one.",
