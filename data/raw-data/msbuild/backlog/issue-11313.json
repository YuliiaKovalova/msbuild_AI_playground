  "body": "### Context\n\ntl;dr;: preserving the previous behavior, and hidden the improvemnet behind opt-in\n\nThe newly added `MSB3002` (`'Explicitly set culture ... was overwritten'`) is a diagnostic informing about a real problem but it has a potential of breaking a build with esoteric conditions where users might not care about their build behaving wrong.\n\nThis was e.g. case solved as part https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/11091 - where a custom injected target was postprocessing `WithCulture` metadata after `AssignCulture` task run. The newly added beahvior broke the task (while adding `RespectAlreadyAssignedItemCulture` fixed the case - it needed an action from the build owner).\n\nAnother case was breakage in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45880 - where the test explicitly counted on failing on `'error MSB3030: Could not copy the file \"<...>.resources.dll\" because it was not found.'`, while the new behavior lead to success build with warning.\n\nWhile both cases are quite edgy - it shows the change has potential to break.\n\n### Suggestion\n\nHide the improved behavior behind explicit opt-in\n\nThe other options:\n * Leave it as opt-out, with warning, while behavior unchanges (the explicit `Culture` metadata would be overwritten by extension derived culture)\n * Leave it as opt-out without warning, while changing beahivor (explicit `Culture` metada would be always respectd)\n\nThose two are not recommended as they have higher potential of back compat breakages",
