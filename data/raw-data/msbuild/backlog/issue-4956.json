  "body": "When `/bl` is used (== MSBUILDLOGTASKINPUTS is set) RAR logs its full set of inputs twice (once by the general mechanism to log task inputs and once by its own custom detailed input logger).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/679326/70252040-b2343f80-17a6-11ea-996f-0307b1d8ff2c.png)\r\n\r\nWe should detect this situation and only log all inputs once (decide whether to just keep the automatic logging or turn off automatic logging in favor of better manual logging). It's important to ensure that whatever we keep it should be a full superset of whatever we delete.\r\n\r\nI expect this this should significantly help with both build performance and binlog sizes. RAR inputs are by far the biggest contributor to binlog size.",

That feels cleaner than special-casing the general mechanism to know about RAR.\r\n\r\n> RAR inputs are by far the biggest contributor to binlog size.\r\n\r\nI wish. C++ projects are much, much worse.",
