  "body": "Hey,\r\nI have been trying to rely on ProjectCachePluginBase from a build server, but when submitting build to a different node, the `ProjectCachePluginBase` that was instantiated in the server is not propagated to the msbuild nodes.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking at that code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/2e437e9251488620d5ea8d9b316d1a7f66d6114c/src/Build/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L758-L762\r\n\r\nIt seems that even If I wanted to try to inject the plugin via a `ProjectCachePlugin` item to the other msbuild nodes, I would not still be able to do it.\r\n\r\nAnything I'm missing or this is something not possible today? \r\n\r\nInstead of checking for VS, couldn't we check for an env variable or a property passed to msbuild?\r\n\r\nThis particular bit is quite annoying, as I'm gonna need to fork somehow MSBuild to achieve this... I have more questions/suggestions with caching, but I will open another issue.\r\n\r\ncc: @KirillOsenkov \r\n",

We can take a patch that adds `|| trait-check` that goes back to an environment variable. IIRC we didn't want to expose a command-line argument for this _because_ that would be hard to deal with in VS (without changes on the VS side) but I don't think that's a strong long-term commitment.",
