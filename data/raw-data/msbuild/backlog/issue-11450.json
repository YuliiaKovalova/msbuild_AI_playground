  "body": "Just upgraded to `VS 17.13`. Now `msbuild` fails to build my solutions. E.g. `msbuild test.sln` gives me this error:\n\n```\nC:\\git\\test.sln : error MSB4025: The project file could not be loade\nd. System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. ---> Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence.Model.Soluti\nonException: The file version '13' is unsupported.\n```\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. Create an empty C++ project/solution.\n2. Change the version of the `.sln` file to `13.00`. Not sure where I got this number from, but it's been in our repo for many years.\n\n```sln\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 13.00\n```\nIf you search `Github` for that string, you'll find some 1200 references. What's up with this?",

Please change it to 12.00.\n\nPreviously this worked because MSBuild solution parser didn't check the format version. Now, we use `Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence` to parse solution. The change was introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/10836\n\nHere is the test ensuring this https://github.com/microsoft/vs-solutionpersistence/blob/0b6f82a4073ce0ff0419991ea0cd6dd6898a51ac/test/Microsoft.VisualStudio.SolutionPersistence.Tests/Serialization/InvalidSolutions.cs#L190\n",
