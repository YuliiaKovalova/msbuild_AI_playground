  "title": "UWP - Unable to exclude the referenced projects in the PRI file generation",
  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIn my UWP solution, I have a ClassLibrary1 project (with a BlankPage1.xaml) and a ClassLibrary2 project that references the ClassLibrary1 project (with a BlankPage2.xaml).\r\n\r\nI want to be able to do 2 NuGet packages (one for ClassLibrary1 and another for the ClassLibrary2).\r\nThe problem is when I generate the library layout for ClassLibrary2, it also include the BlankPage1.xaml of the ClassLibrary1. How can I indicate to not include the ressources of ClassLibrary1 in the ClassLibrary2.pri file ?\r\n\r\nThis is a [sample project](https://github.com/kakone/PriGeneration/) that reproduces the problem. If you compile the PriGeneration project, it will fail with these errors (because theses 3 files are not included in the ClassLibrary2 NuGet package) :\r\n```\r\nError: Could not copy the file \"C:\\Users\\xxx\\.nuget\\packages\\classlibrary2\\1.0.0\\lib\\uap10.0.16299\\ClassLibrary1\\BlankPage1.xbf\" because it was not found.\r\nError: Could not copy the file \"C:\\Users\\xxx\\.nuget\\packages\\classlibrary2\\1.0.0\\lib\\uap10.0.16299\\ClassLibrary1\\BlankPage1.xaml\" because it was not found.\r\nError: Could not copy the file \"C:\\Users\\xxx\\.nuget\\packages\\classlibrary2\\1.0.0\\lib\\uap10.0.16299\\ClassLibrary1\\ClassLibrary1.xr.xml\" because it was not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nTo have an option to not include the referenced projects in the PRI file generation.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe generated library layout always include all the resources of the referenced projects.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output: 16.5.0.12403\r\n\r\nOS info:\r\nVisual Studio 16.5.4\r\n",
