  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n#9627\r\n\r\nUsers should be able to turn off or on the anlyzers run globally (in order to speedup or troubleshoot problematci runs), regardless of what will be the default behavior. At the same time MSBuild team should have a default behavior (likely it's opt-in-only in initial versions, then opt-out-only later on), which might as well be influenced by concrete run scenario (sdk run, msbuild.exe run, API invoking, binlog replay, etc.)\r\n\r\nAs part of this item one should propose and find consensus for opting in and out of anlyzing behavior. An inspiration might be a TerminalLogger opt -in/-out behavior (but hopefully we should start more simple).\r\nSample initial behavior might be as follows:\r\n * Off by default in all scenarios\r\n * Env var for overriding the default behavior\r\n * Cmd switch for overriding default or env\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n* TerminalLogger opt-in/out code: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/e71eb7a1fc535b438007286c840d7cecc139d13b/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L2715-L2910\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @baronfel to express opinions on desired behavior",

This model is ideally what I would like us to use, as users are already trained in this mode of use.",
