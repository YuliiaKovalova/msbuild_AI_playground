  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nWe've created a Pre-Build event which runs a command to install/update webcompiler. However this fails with the message:\r\n```\r\nTarget ToolRestore:\r\n  Using \"Exec\" task from assembly \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\".\r\n  Task \"Exec\"\r\n    dotnet tool update Excubo.WebCompiler\r\n    'C:\\Users\\SomeUser' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\n    operable program or batch file.\r\n    C:\\git\\projects\\project-x\\src\\ProjectX\\ProjectX.csproj(78,9): error MSB3073: The command \"dotnet tool update Excubo.WebCompiler\" exited with code 1.\r\n  Done executing task \"Exec\" -- FAILED.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n<!--\r\n* Include as much of the following as possible:\r\n\r\n* A minimal sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n* Your zipped project.\r\n* IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour.\r\n* Your command line invocation\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Create a local Windows User with a special character in it: `SomeUser(Company)`\r\n2. Login to that user\r\n3. Create new Console Project (.NET 5)\r\n4. Add a prebuild task\r\n```\r\n<Target Name=\"ToolRestore\" BeforeTargets=\"PreBuildEvent\">\r\n    <Exec Command=\"dotnet tool update Excubo.WebCompiler\" StandardOutputImportance=\"high\" ContinueOnError=\"false\" IgnoreExitCode=\"false\" LogStandardErrorAsError=\"false\" />\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n5. Add a manifest file: `dotnet new tool-manifest`\r\n6. Build project.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe project builds without errors.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe project fails to run the command in the target `ToolRestore`. \r\nThe output is:\r\n```\r\nTarget ToolRestore:\r\n  Using \"Exec\" task from assembly \"Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\".\r\n  Task \"Exec\"\r\n    dotnet tool update Excubo.WebCompiler\r\n    'C:\\Users\\SomeUser' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\n    operable program or batch file.\r\n    C:\\git\\projects\\project-x\\src\\ProjectX\\ProjectX.csproj(78,9): error MSB3073: The command \"dotnet tool update Excubo.WebCompiler\" exited with code 1.\r\n  Done executing task \"Exec\" -- FAILED.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nOur user folder has a special character in it:\r\n`C:/Users/SomeUser(Company)`\r\nSince the tools are collected within your `%APPDATA%` folder it cannot find these and we're left with the message:\r\n`'C:\\Users\\SomeUser' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` not the missing `(`\r\n\r\nWe've **excluded** the tool in question `Excubo.WebCompiler` as it also occurs with many other tools.\r\n\r\n### Example program\r\nMade a sample project for demonstrating purposes\r\n[PreBuildEvent.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/6733151/PreBuildEvent.zip)\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\git\\projects\\project-x> msbuild -version\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.2+857e5a733 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

If yes i'm eager to try it out as it helps us save time by reconfiguring up to 5 pc's removing the `(` and `)` from the user' folder",

Some of them were still on 16.9.x\r\n\r\nThey indeed got errors trying to build this project. I told them to update and print me the msbuild versions they were using and after updating they got at version `16.10.2+857e5a733` (the latest release).\r\nWith the updates installed they successfully built the project so I think this issue can be closed and marked fixed in mentioned PR. \r\n\r\nThanks for pointing to the PR and the prompt result.",
