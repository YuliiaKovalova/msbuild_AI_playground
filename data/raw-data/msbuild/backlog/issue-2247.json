  "title": "High allocation rates in Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable",
  "body": "During a profiling pass on loading Roslyn.sln with Visual Studio 15.3 Preview 3, 6.2% of the overall GC allocations were caused by the call to `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MSBUILDUSECASESENSITIVEITEMNAMES\")` in ``LazyItemEvaluator`4+OperationBuilder``. Another 0.2% was caused by the call to `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"MSBUILDENABLEALLPROPERTYFUNCTIONS\")` in ``Expander`2+Function`1.IsStaticMethodAvailable``. It appears that both of these cases can be cached for a substantial reduction in GC pressure.",
