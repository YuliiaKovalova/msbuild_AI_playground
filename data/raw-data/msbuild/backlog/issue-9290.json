  "title": "Enhance logging to enable correct tracking of task assemblies",
  "body": "Currently the `Using \"{0}\" task from assembly \"{1}\".` log message contains only the bare task name. Similarly, `TaskStartedEventArgs` carries only the task name, without additional parameters like architecture and runtime.  In cases where multiple tasks of the same name are loaded from different assemblies, it is impossible to reconstruct from logs information on which task was actually invoked.\r\n\r\nProbably the most straightforward fix would be to include architecture & runtime (or `taskIdentityParameters` in general) in the message and event args, to allow log viewers to match them exactly.",
