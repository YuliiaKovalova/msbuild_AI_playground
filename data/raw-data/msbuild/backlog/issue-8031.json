Please use any relevant sections and delete anything you don't need. -->\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\nRunning on **.NET 7 RC 1**, Ubuntu x64 VM, I have intermittent errors - no changes to code and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If I get into this state, nuking `artifacts` and `.dotnet` does not help, only reboot seems to help.\r\n\r\nI have a very basic setup with custom MSBuild task:\r\n- Project: https://github.com/dotnet/installer/blob/main/src/VirtualMonoRepo/Tasks/VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks.csproj\r\n- Single custom task inside: https://github.com/dotnet/installer/blob/main/src/VirtualMonoRepo/Tasks/VirtualMonoRepo_Initialize.cs\r\n- `UsingTask` here: https://github.com/dotnet/installer/blob/80ff259cd513dc72a84e347f5b27c9fd9f7094d6/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj#L24\r\n\r\nI get following error:\r\n```\r\n/home/prvysoky/installer/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj(75,5): error MSB4062: The \"Microsoft.DotNet.VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks.VirtualMonoRepo_Initialize\" task could not be loaded from the assembly /home/prvysoky/installer/artifacts/bin/VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks/Debug/net7.0/VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks.dll. Culture is not supported. (Parameter 'name')\r\n/home/prvysoky/installer/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj(75,5): error MSB4062: vider>b__30_1 is an invalid culture identifier. Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nIt's not a 100% repro but the commands needed are this:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/premun/installer\r\ngit checkout prvysoky/submodules\r\ncd installer\r\n./build.sh /p:InitializeVMR=true /p:TmpDir=/data/tmp /p:VmrDir=/data/vmr /bl\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither it fails very fast or it says \"Initializing empty VMR...\" and then it means the task was loaded properly.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nTask should be loaded from the assembly without problems.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nMSBuild fails to load the custom task with the following error:\r\n```\r\n/home/prvysoky/installer/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj(75,5): error MSB4062: The \"Microsoft.DotNet.VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks.VirtualMonoRepo_Initialize\" task could not be loaded from the assembly /home/prvysoky/installer/artifacts/bin/VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks/Debug/net7.0/VirtualMonoRepo.Tasks.dll. Culture is not supported. (Parameter 'name')\r\n/home/prvysoky/installer/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj(75,5): error MSB4062: vider>b__30_1 is an invalid culture identifier. Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nSometimes I get this:\r\n```\r\n/home/prvysoky/installer/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj(75,5): error MSB4018: System.InvalidOperationException: A suitable constructor for type 't.han' could not be located. Ensure the type is concrete and services are registered for all parameters of a public constructor.\r\n```\r\n\r\nsometimes this:\r\n```\r\n/home/prvysoky/installer/src/VirtualMonoRepo/InitializeVMR.proj(75,5): error MSB4062: vider>b__30_1 is an invalid culture identifier. \r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like it's getting pieces of the source file and using it as the culture?\r\n\r\nReboot seems to help always.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n- .NET `7.0.0-rc.1.22426.10`",
