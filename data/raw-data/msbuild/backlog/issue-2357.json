  "body": "Hi.\r\n\r\nWhy does the indentation of long messages that are wrapped not have correct indentation on each wrapped line? \r\nOn windows it works correctly like this: \r\n![msbuild](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3228043/28671740-087e1282-72de-11e7-9f58-8a82032e7c34.png)\r\nbut on Linux, instead of getting the expected result, I get this:\r\n![screenshot at 2017-07-27 15 10 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3228043/28671741-08802158-72de-11e7-881a-abfd04f0a17b.png)\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, only the first part of the message is indented but not the rest.\r\n\r\nHope this will be fixed, because I do not think this is the intended way it should work.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There's a `FORCENOALIGN` switch on the logger but it's a huge pain to use, since you get a console logger \"for free\".",

        "body": "@rainersigwald I understand your displeasure with indented logs. What I used to do was to use a file logger if I ever had to copy a command from the output. Of course you need and extra file, and then open it and copy, but it is not that much of a hassle IMO (I have done it a lot before).\r\nIt is amazing how much a simple indentation can do when navigating through \"endless\" logs in the terminal, so I would very much appreciate if this feature was turned on to make it more in line with what I am used to on Windows.
