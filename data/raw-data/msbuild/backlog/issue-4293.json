  "body": "I noticed that the MSBuild 16 binaries have `AssemblyFileVersion` and `AssemblyInformationalVersion` values that indicate they are version 16, but the `AssemblyVersion` is still 15.1.0.0.\r\n\r\nI assume this was done for some sort of compatibility reason, but I'm curious about the specifics. Why couldn't you also bump it up to 16.0.0.0?",
