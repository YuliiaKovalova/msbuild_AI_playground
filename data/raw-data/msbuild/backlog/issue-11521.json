        "body": "Hi - there's not enough here for us to help with. Since this is about making NuGet packages, please raise your issue over at NuGet/Home, where the Packaging tasks and logic are maintained. In addition, you will likely need a [binlog](https://aka.ms/binlog) in order to piece together what's going wrong. Finally, some concrete failures other than \"Does not work\" will likely also be needed in order to help you solve your problem.",

The issue you mention has a _very wide_ set of potential triggers, which is why I asked for a binlog. I appreciate that you are frustrated, but if you want to actually solve your problem you need to give more constructive answers.",
