In order to target \".NETFramework,Versio\r\nn=v3.5\", .NET Framework v3.5 Service Pack 1 or later must be installed.

See https://github.com/dotnet/installer/issues/2022 for details.\r\n\r\nFortunately, our friend @jnm2 went out of his way to fill this gap and created this awesome package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/jnm2.ReferenceAssemblies.net35\r\n\r\nHowever I found that it still doesn't work because of this check that checks for the \"sentinel\" System.Data.Entity.dll being installed in the GAC:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/e8c17c128ed847d4acd278b42a02df9621bd1652/src/Tasks/GetReferenceAssemblyPaths.cs#L160-L183\r\n",
