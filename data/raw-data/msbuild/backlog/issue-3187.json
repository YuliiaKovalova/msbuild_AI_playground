  "body": "In source-build, for all repos that are using RoslynTools, we\u2019re building one version of RoslynTools and providing that to the repo rather than having each repo install their own version.  MsBuild uses an older version of RoslynTools that doesn't support source-build.  This should be update to use the common version built with source-build.",
