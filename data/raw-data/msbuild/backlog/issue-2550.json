(The main csproj see here: https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/blob/master/ICSharpCode.Decompiler/ICSharpCode.Decompiler.csproj)\r\n\r\n(Note: On Windows we use ILSpy.sln on Unix we use ICSharpCode.Decompiler.Console.sln)\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly fine on Windows, however when we try to open/build the project on mac/unix. VSmac and msbuild cannot open the project unless the `Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\"` is added, however, when we add that on Windows as well, we get some warnings.\r\n\r\n> \\ILSpy\\ICSharpCode.Decompiler\\ICSharpCode.Decompiler.csproj(3,3): warning MSB4011: \"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.0.0\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\Sdk\\Sdk.props\" cannot be imported again. It was already imported at \"\\ILSpy\\ICSharpCode.Decompiler\\ICSharpCode.Decompiler.csproj\". This is most likely a build authoring error. This subsequent import will be ignored.\r\n\r\nSeems like #1392 is not fully supported on Unix.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to define the Sdk attribute conditionally (in one single file)? Using a separate csproj file per platform is not a usable workaround as all msbuild projects in the same directory use `obj\\project.assets.json` and conflict with each other (among other problems we've experienced...).",
