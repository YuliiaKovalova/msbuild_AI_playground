  "body": "### Background \r\n #6215\r\n This subitem is focused on code in `src/Deprecated/*`\r\n Currently 11 usages. Hopefuly this doesn't need to be touched, or at worst just conditioned, otherwise cost might be significant\r\n\r\n### Expected output \r\nFind answers to below questions (and if any work is recommended to be done - create item for next sprint):\r\n * Are there any scenarios where code in `src/Deprecated/*` can be part of NET binaries (not FullFW)?\r\n * Is it find to ceompletely left out this code from BinaryFormatter deprecation effort? Or do we need put usages behind explicit opt-in?\r\n * Based on above findings - what is the suggested resolution for code in `src/Deprecated/*`?\r\n",
