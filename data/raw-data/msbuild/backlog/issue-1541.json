  "body": "It'd be nice to have an easy \"detect duplicates in item list\" operation. There is already a core task `RemoveDuplicates`, but it returns only the deduplicated list--not an indication of whether it differs from the input. For use cases like https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/624, it could also return a `bool ListHadDuplicates` that could be used to generate errors or go into a different codepath.",

I'd be happy to implement that as well, if I can get this task assigned to me.\r\n\r\nSee my related question in the [MSBuild docs about whether RemoveDuplicates is guaranteed to return the input list in the same order](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/visualstudio-docs/issues/622), which was prompted by writing something like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"CheckNoDuplicateFooItems\"\r\n        BeforeTargets=\"DoSomethingWithFoo\"\r\n        Condition=\"'@(Foo)' != ''\">\r\n  <RemoveDuplicates\r\n      Inputs=\"@(Foo)\">\r\n    <Output\r\n        TaskParameter=\"Filtered\"\r\n        ItemName=\"_FooFiltered\"/>\r\n  </RemoveDuplicates>\r\n\r\n  <Error Text=\"The Foo item contains duplicates. Ensure that each Foo item is only included once. (Check for explicit includes and globs that also match.)\"\r\n         Condition=\" '@(Foo)' != '@(_FooFiltered)' \" />\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand needing to know whether the flattened strings were going to differ due to ordering and not just duplicateness.",
