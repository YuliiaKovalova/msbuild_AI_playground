  "title": "Suggestion: Build in base64 converter",
  "body": "There a lots of cases where 'odd' parameters need to get passed to msbuild, often through other scripts. Most commonly are URIs, SAS tokens, etc., which tend to contain elements (?, ;, &, %) that could get reinterpreted by the various scripting languages as well as msbuild itself. This has become especially common as we try to have the same builds run across multiple operating systems.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this is to pass thing through as environment variables, but this isn't great practice from a cleanliness and isolation standpoint. The other common solution is to encode strings as Base64, then decode them at the usage site. MSBuild doesn't have a built-in property function for this, unfortunately. We're left creating the same task over and over.\r\n\r\nAny way this could be added as a property function to msbuild? To/From base64",
