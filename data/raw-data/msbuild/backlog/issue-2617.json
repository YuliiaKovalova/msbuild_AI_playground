  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn the old _csproj_ file, we could set `AssemblyVersion(\"1.0.*\")` (in the _AssemblyInfo.cs_ file) to have the assembly version auto increment by itself.\r\n\r\nCurrently (VS 15.3.5) when trying to set this in new project types, I get this error:\r\n\r\n>Error CS7034: The specified version string does not conform to the required format - major[.minor[.build[.revision]]]\r\n\r\nThis used to be a very useful feature for many years. I beg you to please bring it back.",
