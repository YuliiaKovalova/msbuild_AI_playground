  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n[CoreBuildTest.zip](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/files/1575617/CoreBuildTest.zip)\r\n\r\nOpen the solution in VS 2017. Make any change to Program.cs (e.g. add a space) and build the solution. Build the solution a second time.\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nThe second time all projects are considered up to date and not rebuilt. Build Output window shows\r\n\r\n    ========== Build: 0 succeeded, 0 failed, 2 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nConsoleApp1 is rebuilt every time:\r\n\r\n    ========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 1 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.5.180.51428 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n15.5.180.51428\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS info: Visual Studio 15.5.2 on Windows 7 x64 SP1\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nIf I either add or remove a project reference in ConsoleApp1 and build then the project is considered up-to-date from then on (further builds do not rebuild) until I modify a source file again.",
