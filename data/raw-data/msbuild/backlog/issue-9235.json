  "title": "[Feature Request]: Create an 'umbrella' property to enable hardlinks for every use case",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nWe should provide a single knob that users can set to opt in to hardlinks everywhere - for both our current set of hardlinks as well as all future uses of them.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nUsers currently have to set multiple flags to get this behavior, and this is not resilient to new uses of hardlinks in MSBuild. An example of this is [from Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/579d96b62f1c7ce51219b54401dfdc70eda4fbac/eng/targets/Settings.props#L167-L172).\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nWe should provide a `UseHardLinksGlobally` property that users could set that would opt into every use case of hardlinks that we currently support, as well as all future ones.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
