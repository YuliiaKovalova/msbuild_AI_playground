  "body": "> from https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/4796 based on https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/4796#issuecomment-262077083.\r\n\r\nI can see the below conditional properties inside my csproj file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup Condition=\" '$(TargetFramework)' == 'netcoreapp1.0' \">\r\n   <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NETCore.App\">\r\n     <Version>1.1.0</Version>\r\n   </PackageReference>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is really hard to remember and hand-type. I am not going to get into how this was easy in project.json (opps, I did). At least it would be nice to simplify this like below:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Framework name=\"netcoreapp1.0\">\r\n   <Dependencies>\r\n      <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NETCore.App\">\r\n          <Version>1.1.0</Version>\r\n      </PackageReference>\r\n   </Dependencies>\r\n</Framework>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n`dotnet --info` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZ:\\>dotnet --info\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (1.0.0-preview3-004056)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            1.0.0-preview3-004056\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  ccc4968bc3\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.10240\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I just think that this scenario worked way better in project.json, and I hope things improve before RTM (I already saw a tweet / image somewhere that there is already an ongoing effort to reduce the bloat of a minimal csproj).\r\n\r\nReducing the verbosity combined with IntelliSense support (like project.json had) for the packages and versions would be great!",
