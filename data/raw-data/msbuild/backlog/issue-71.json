  "body": "Calls to _SecurityUtilities.SignFile_ referencing a certificate that does not include a private key result in a very non-specific _NullReferenceException_. This would be easier for the caller to fix if a more useful message were provided.\n\nBased on what's already thrown from that method, I would suggest something like an _InvalidOperationException_ with the message: \"MSB3487: The signing certificate does not include private key information.\"\n",
