We had (benign) duplicate entries. This worked fine on 6.0.302, but now on 6.0.400 this results in build failures.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/erinlah-ms/bug-repros/tree/main/repro-packageversiondup\r\n\r\n1. install just 6.0.302 sdk\r\n2. clone folder linked above\r\n3. cd original\r\n4. dotnet restore. Note no errors\r\n5. install 6.0.400 sdk (don't uninstall .302)\r\n6. dotnet restore. \r\n7. cd workaround\r\n8. dotnet restore\r\n9. open visual studio 17.3.0 (latest VS 2022 Enterprise)\r\n10. build/restore the workaround.csproj from visual studio\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nError at step 6, building original.csproj, no errors at step 8 or 10 building workaround.csproj\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nStep 10 fails to restore/build in visual studio, despite workaround.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nIt appears that release .400 introduced a new warning for duplicate PackageVersion entries. This broke our repo.\r\n\r\nNormally we would just workaround the issue until such time as we could fix it. However, Visual Studio does not permit the user to downgrade to an older release of msbuild. Building the 'workaround.csproj' folder under visual studio still fails.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio lacks an option to honor the msbuild/sdk version selected in the repo. It partially ignores global.json by using the version/build of msbuild that is shipped in box in visual studio, including using the targets/tasks defined in that version of msbuild.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nDotnetsdk 6.0.302 / dotnet msbuild 17.2.0+41abc5629\r\ndotnetsdk 6.0.400 / dotnet msbuild  17.3.0+92e077650\r\nVisual Studio 2022 Enterprise 17.3.0",
