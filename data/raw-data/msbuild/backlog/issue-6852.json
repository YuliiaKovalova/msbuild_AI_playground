  "body": "Several build processes (repos, SDKs, and NuGet packages) have a pattern where they want to do a thing \"once per build\"--maybe set up versioning, or run some code generator, or something.\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be easy to express this in a `-graph -isolate` compatible way by creating an item something like\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<MSBuildGraphEdge Include=\"my/weird/project.proj\"\r\n                  Targets=\"This;List;Overrides\"\r\n                  Properties=\"Foo=Bar;\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be a totally new edge, ignoring target propagation.",

Without this ProjectReference item, `-graph -isolate` fails for Nerdbank.GitVersioning projects. But *with* this item, at least 10 project types fail to build because they indiscriminately execute their ProjectReference items with assumptions about how they should behave, targets they implement, or files that would be in one of their directories.\r\nI'm about to just remove the ProjectReference item and break -graph -isolate scenarios given how much trouble it's caused for customers. Can you give me an alternative?",
