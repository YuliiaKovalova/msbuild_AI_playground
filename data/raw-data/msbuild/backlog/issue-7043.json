  "title": "Consider replacing CoreCompileCache with Roslyn DeterministicKey",
  "body": "Roslyn is considering exposing an API to compute a key that describes the inputs to a compilation (dotnet/roslyn#57162).\r\n\r\nThat could be used to replace the CoreCompileCache concept in Common.targets:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7434b575d12157ef98aeaad3b86c8f235f551c41/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L3643-L3673\r\n\r\nThat was introduced to avoid problems with the Compile list changing between runs (#1328).\r\n\r\nHowever, if Roslyn exposed a task with similar API to the `Csc`/`Vbc` tasks that returned (something like) the DeterministicKey instead of doing compilation, we could use that output instead (instead of having to follow the `CoreCompile` inputs as in #5334).\r\n\r\nThis came up when @RikkiGibson and I were talking about some stuff.",

        "body": "This seems like a good use case for the API. Calculating this key though does require us to effectively read in all of the files that will be used in a compilation event: source files, references, etc ... The key is content based hence it needs the values. \r\n\r\nGiven we'd likely do this work in the server that probably won't add a ton of cost. Many of the values are already cached there but do want to make sure we're clear that is part of the operation here. ",
