  "body": "WriteLinesToFile appends by default unless you specify Overwrite. This is highly non-intuitive and probably almost never what the user intends.\n\nSince we can't change the behavior, I propose to introduce a new optional parameter Append, that defaults to false, and if it's not specified and Overwrite is not specified, warn about it (that you should specify one or the other). \n\nNot sure if a warning or a message, perhaps build check?",
