  "title": "[Performance]: Very slow vsix build in github actions",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe build speed of a small vsix project is extremely long in github actions but pretty fast locally\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nYou can clone this repo to reproduce the issue: https://github.com/taori/S4u.Analyzers/actions/runs/14934579069\n\nIn GitHub i am having a 6 minute build, which was one of the faster ones. If i recall correctly i have seen 9 minute runs too, while locally this takes between 3-5 seconds\n\n[This](https://github.com/taori/S4u.Analyzers/tree/main/analyzers/Logging/scripts) script does essentially the same as the build in GHA, but for some reason on github it is 70x-100x slower.\n\nNote that this is a absolutely tiny extension at this stage, so even 6 minute build time would be crazy\n\n### Data\n\nSee reproduction sample\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_\n\n### Regression\n\n- [x] yes\n- [ ] no\n\n### Regression Details\n\nwith a different extension in the past i recall it beeing about 2-3 minutes, so it probably might be a regression, yes.",
