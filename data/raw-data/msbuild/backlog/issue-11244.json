  "title": "Remove \"Detail Summary\" from binary logger",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nWhen logging with binary logger, a section of the binlog is dedicated to storing Detail Summary.  The Detail Summary is an ascii graph representing the build timeline.  However, it is possible to reconstruct the graph with greater fidelity.  \n\n### Background and Motivation\n\n|Size | msbuild.exe /bl | msbuild.exe /bl /ds:false | difference\n|-|-|-|-|\nMid size solution | 34,910,977 bytes | 33,710,811 bytes | 3% reduction\nLarge size solution | 94,076,308 bytes | 87,592,988 bytes |  7.4% reduction\n\nIn our CI system, the binary logs are kept for a long time so the total space saving can easily add up.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nWhen using the switch `/bl`, it will enable Detail Summary by default.  The propose change is to set the behavior to be off by default.  \n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
