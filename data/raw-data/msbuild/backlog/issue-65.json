  "body": "Hello I would like to use MSBuild on a buildserver without installing it or Visual Studio. I already got the VC++ compiler to run standalone on virtual machine but I also need MSBuild to build the VC++-Solution.\n\nI noticed that the Visual C++ tasks are missing. Is it possible that you add them to the Github repository or is there a way to include the tasks and properties that are bundled with Visual Studio 2015 Preview?\n\nThanks in advance.\n",
