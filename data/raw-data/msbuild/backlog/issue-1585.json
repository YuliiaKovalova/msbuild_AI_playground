  "body": "Related internal bug: https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems?id=368856\r\n\r\nWhen a task assembly has a dependency on Roslyn assemblies, it will try to load Roslyn and its dependencies into the MSBuild.exe process. That can fail if there is a third-part version mismatch on fa\u00e7ade assemblies. We've observed two:\r\n\r\n| Assembly                                | MSBuild | Roslyn |\r\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| System.IO.FileSystem                    | 4.0.1   | 4.0.2  |\r\n| System.Security.Cryptography.Primitives | 4.0.0   | 4.0.1  |\r\n\r\nBut there may be others not hit in the scenario we've observed so far.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #1527 which was the same problem for `System.Collections.Immutable`. We should audit for other facades as well.\r\n\r\nThis is also related to #1542--if we deliver the fa\u00e7ades they should be of the right version.",
