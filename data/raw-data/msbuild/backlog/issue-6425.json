  "body": "Using existing infrastructure code, define and handle message (INodePacket) for MSBuild Server request.\r\n\r\nWork breakdown:\r\n- define message format: (header(type, len), string(workingDirectory), string(command line)\r\n- handle 'MSBuild Server request' message by calling MSBuild entry point\r\n- use named mutex to guarantee build exclusivity (no concurrent builds are allowed)\r\n- if build is already running reply with message MSBuildServerBusy - that will be handled by caller by fallbacking to standard non-server entry point (running new MSBuild process, loading MSBuild.dll into CLI and start it, ...)\r\n- after build is finished reply with message MSBuildServerDone containing same exit code as would MSBuild process returned\r\n- introduce ETL events to trace and measure perf of above",
