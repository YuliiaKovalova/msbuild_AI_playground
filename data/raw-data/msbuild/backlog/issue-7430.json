  "body": "The `GenerateAdditionalSources` target is used to generate AssemblyAttributes like [AssemblyVersion]:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/40f49cd8d06ec3ed6933fa66183e8d1615cb2edc/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L3568\r\n\r\nHowever it runs after MarkupCompile, and GenerateTemporaryTargetAssembly doesn't take it into account.\r\n\r\nSo at the time BAML is compiled, the default 0.0.0.0 version is being baked into BAML (since the temp assembly passed to MarkupCompilePass2 doesn't have the version set yet). This causes runtime exceptions.\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure that the files generated during the build are added to GenerateTemporaryTargetAssembly.",

I think we need to be good stewards of the ecosystem and own this scenario given how much funding the WPF team has been receiving in recent years.",
