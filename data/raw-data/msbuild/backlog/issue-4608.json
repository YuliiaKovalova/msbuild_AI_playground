  "body": "For calculating code metrics I have included Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Metrics 2.9.4 nuget package to my csproj project.\r\nBefore executing msbuild from the command line, I have called \"nuget.exe restore\", and it correctly found MSBuild and restore package:\r\n\r\n> \"MSBuild auto-detection: using msbuild version '16.200.19.32702' from 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\Current\\bin'.\r\n> Restoring NuGet package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Metrics.2.9.4. ...\"\r\n\r\nThen, from command line I am calling msbuild with /t:Metrics option:\r\n\r\n> \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\BuildTools\\MSBuild\\Current\\bin\\MSBuild.exe\" /p:Configuration=Debug /t:Metrics My.sln \"\r\n\r\nwhich ended with following error:\r\n\r\n> \"Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Directory \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\TestAgent\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\" does not exist\r\n> Parameter name: msbuildPath\r\n> at Microsoft.Build.Locator.MSBuildLocator.RegisterMSBuildPath(String msbuildPath)\r\n> at Microsoft.Build.Locator.MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults()\r\n> at Metrics.Program.d__1.MoveNext()\r\n> --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n> at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n> at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\"\r\n\r\nIt looks like Metrics.exe was started from msbuild itself and can't find it location, but nuget.exe did?\r\n",
