The compiler tried to compile many files in the \"None\" property in the target file and hit CS2015 error. I posted the details on the internal stackoverflow. \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.microsoft.com/questions/294670\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\nThis issue is only on 17.1.0. I repro the issue on two PCs with 17.1.0 for the same project. I didn't see this issue before. I also tried on 17.0.6 for the same code on the third PC which works fine. \r\n\r\n",
