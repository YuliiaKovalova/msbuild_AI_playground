  "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI am using the `Microsoft.Build.Evaluation` classes in order to parse and manipulate some `Version` strings for `PackageVersion` and for `Version` attribute of `PackageReferences`. \r\n\r\nWhen I have a `PackageVersion` property, that looks like this: \r\n```xml\r\n<PackageVersion>$(MyPackageVersion)</PackageVersion>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then I have `Directory.Build.props` file with the following:\r\n```xml\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n\t<MyPackageVersion>10.5.1</MyPackageVersion>\r\n</PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\nthen the `PackageVersion` property has `IsImported` set to `true` and I can use the `ContainingProject` to change it in the source file (`Directory.Build.props`).\r\n\r\nBut if I have the following:\r\n```xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"MyFancyPackage\" Version=\"$(MyPackageVersion)\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the `ProjectMetadata` item for `Version` has `IsImported` set to `false` and the `ContainingProject` is the `.csproj` itself, instead of the `Directory.Build.props`. Despite that, the `EvaluatedValue` is correct - `10.5.1`.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\nIs that intended behavior? If that is the case, how should I then proceed to do that change?\r\nIf this is not the behavior, then is it a bug?",

The **value** of the property is coming from an imported property, not the property itself. \r\n\r\nMy bad. I will close that issue now. Still the showcase will be there to serve as an example.",
