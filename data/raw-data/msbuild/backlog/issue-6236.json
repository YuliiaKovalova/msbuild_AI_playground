  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nWeb site projects in the solution will break the build. Note, by web site project, I mean web site projects(WSP), not web application projects (WAP).\r\n\r\nThe last working version of MSBuild: packaged with the 16.8.6 version of Visual Studio 2019.\r\n\r\nKnown broken versions:\r\n`Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.9.0+57a23d249 for .NET Framework`, with Visual Studio 16.9.1. \r\nThe version packaged with Visual Studio 16.9.0.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Install 16.9.1 version of Visual studio.\r\n2. Create a console project\r\n3. Add an existing website from the local IIS installation.\r\n4. Run msbuild via commandline, something like `msbuild /m -t:\"clean;build\" .\\WebsiteBugIssueRepro.sln`\r\n5. Error in build should appear.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe build should successfully complete.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nAn error is thrown during the build.",

        "body": "Based on some ad-hoc guess debugging, one of our developers believed the source of the issue was\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The new MSBuild adds a property group for every project referenced in the solution, it does this by retrieving the absolute path on the disk for the project in the solution file will be written out in the property group in memory as full path of the project by the method `AddPropertyGroupForSolutionConfiguration`. The `AbsolutePath` property of the `ProjectInSolution` class is implemented here and gets the path of the project in the solution file and combine it with the solution file directory:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Solution file path\r\n> 2. Relative path of a project, you can see this by examining the solution file.\r\n> 3. Combining 1 and 2 and you get the absolute path.\r\n> \r\n> The error according to the stack trace comes from here, following this method leads to a `NotSupportedException` which barfs when the function `PathInternal.HasInvalidVolumeSeparator(fullPath))` returns true, the source (and name) indicates somehow a bad character got into the absolute path retrieved above.\r\n> \r\n> The web site project has entries in the solution file, like so:\r\n> Project(\"{E24C65DC-7377-472B-9ABA-BC803B73C61A}\") = \"DummyEndpoints\", \"http://localhost:86/DummyEndpoints\"\r\n> The first string is the project name, the second is the relative path so the generated absolute file is:\r\n> <projectAbsoluteFilePath>\\http://localhost:86/DummyEndpoints\r\n> \r\n> Which naturally generates an error.",

These types of projects put a URL in the solution file as the relative path.\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject(\"{E24C65DC-7377-472B-9ABA-BC803B73C61A}\") = \"WebSite1\", \"http://localhost:8080\", \"{96E0707C-2E9C-4704-946F-FA583147737F}\"\r\nEndProject\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the new call to `Path.GetFullPath()` fails.\r\n\r\nI can fix it pretty easily, we'll just need to get the fix out ASAP.  To fix it, I can catch the exception and return just the `Path.Combine()` like we used to or I could inspect the path to see if its a URL before calling `GetFullPath()`.  Its probably very infrequent that the path would be something that would cause `GetFullPath()` to fail, so I'm leaning towards just catching the exception.  What is everyone's opinion?",
