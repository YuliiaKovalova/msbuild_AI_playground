This can trigger a high severity CG error (https://eng.ms/docs/cloud-ai-platform/devdiv/one-engineering-system-1es/1es-docs/secure-supply-chain/how-to-securely-configure-package-source-files) - however it should be fine to keep this temporary feed untill the release.~\r\n\r\nASAP On/After GA (based on [release schedule (internal)](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_wiki/wikis/DevDiv.wiki/10097/Dev17-Release)):\r\n\r\n- [x]  Push packages to nuget.org (not currently automated, contact dnceng - search \"Publish MSBuild 17.6 to NuGet.org\" email subject for template).\r\n- [x]  Publish docs: submit reference request at https://aka.ms/publishondocs\r\n  - Click on the link labeled *Request \u2013 Reference Publishing*\r\n  - You can use existing [ticket](https://dev.azure.com/msft-skilling/Content/_workitems/edit/183613) as a reference \r\n- [ ] ~Remove the temporarily added [build feed from `nuget.config`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/29397b577e3ec0fe0c7650c3ab0400909655dc88/NuGet.config#L9) if it was added in the `Update the PackageValidationBaselineVersion` step~\r\n- [x]  Update `main` subscriptions to the new channel (this can be done before or after release - depending on when the source repos from our previous - VS 17.10 - channle start to publish in the next - VS 17.11 - channel) \\\r\n`darc get-subscriptions --exact --target-repo https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild --target-branch main`\r\n- [x]  Create the 17.10 release\r\n  - [x]  Create tag (can be done upfront)\r\n  ```\r\n  git checkout <commit noted above>\r\n  git tag v17.10.3\r\n  git push upstream v17.10.3\r\n  ```\r\n  - [x]  Create Release in Github with `Create Release from Tag` GH option (https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/releases/new?tag=v17.9.3) - the release notes can be prepopulated (`Generate Release Notes`)\r\n",
