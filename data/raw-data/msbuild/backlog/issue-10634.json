This is a signal that they are too painful/chatty.\r\n* What checks are being elevated (turned up from their default warnings)?

Is there any other concern?\r\n* Are event names with slashes supported? The final eventname is with slashes - e.g. 'dotnet/cli/msbuild/loggingconfiguration'. But I'm not sure if specifying the last part with slashes matters.\r\n* Do the proposed data look as meeting your requirements?",
