  "title": "Out of Proc Node creation takes too long, very noticeable with many cores.",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nNode creation takes a long time to start a 32 core build.  It took ~12s to start up 32 nodes.  An average of 0.375s per node of single threaded time, and blocking other activity from starting in parallel.  This adds up fast as today's machines are easily 16 threads CPU (~5s 16*0.375s).  5s on a 5 mins build isn't a lot, but an incremental build of 15s is a lot of time.\r\n\r\nSee internal teams thread for SS.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nBuild a large solution with many parallelizable projects.  I used binlog and viewer with tracing to see the start time behavior.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
