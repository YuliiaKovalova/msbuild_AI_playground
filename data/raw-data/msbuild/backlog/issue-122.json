  "body": "In May, I compiled this open source MSBuild and [released it](http://blog.ctaggart.com/2015/05/sourcelinkmsbuild-uploaded-to-nuget.html) expecting it to solve the VisualStudioVersion problems discussed in #52. Unfortunately, it does not appear to working with portable project files, specifically these:\n\nhttps://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/blob/master/src/FSharp.Data.Portable47.fsproj\nhttps://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/blob/master/src/FSharp.Data.Portable7.fsproj\n\nOn AppVeyor it evaluated to `10.0`:\nhttps://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/pull/852\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80104/8436644/90c29e54-1f0e-11e5-8205-0bb067e64d40.png)\n\nOn my computer it evaluated to `11.0`:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80104/8437365/55e8f3d2-1f13-11e5-9ad7-10cae3f6c11a.png)\n\nIn both cases, it should have been set to `12.0` for Visual Studio 2013.\n",
