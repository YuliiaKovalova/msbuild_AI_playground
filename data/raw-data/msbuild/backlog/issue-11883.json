  "title": "Improve Scheduler and Engine logs.",
  "body": "There are several usability issues with the current EngineTrace, SchedulerState, and SchedulerTrace logs that make troubleshooting and log analysis more difficult. Below are the specific problems and suggested enhancements:\n\nProblems\n- Timestamps are hard to align with binary logs.\n- SchedulerTrace logs show request numbers but lack project and target information. As a result, users must join them with SchedulerState logs to understand the context.\n- SchedulerState logs use symbols like \"!\" and \">\" without explanation. Their meaning is not documented or explained within the file.\n\nSuggestions\n- Add project and target information to SchedulerTrace logs (note, this will increase file size). This will make them self-contained and much easier to interpret.\n- Define symbols (such as \"!\" and \">\") at the top of the SchedulerState log file or in some example file for clarity.\n- Or/And document the notation in the MSBuild repository so that users and contributors can easily understand the output and its conventions.\n\nImproving these areas will enhance the usability and readability of the logs for both end users and developers.",
