  "title": "Redirecting MsBuildExtensionsPath causes incorrect double-load warnings",
  "body": "We have an isolation system in place that doesn't depend on MsBuild installation.  As such, we alter $(MsBuildExtensionsPath) early in our project load order.  This has worked fine since MsBuild 4 and earlier, but as of v15 we get load warnings in VisualStudio.  Unclear if this is an MsBuild fault or a VisualStudio fault.\r\n\r\nVS gives this warning\r\n`\t\"D:\\CorextCache\\.A\\MsBuild.Corext.sE2FwIuT0zUvdE9g6wU5UA\\Extensions\\Plugin\\Props\\MsBuild.Tasks.Corext.props\" cannot be imported again. It was already imported at \"D:\\CorextCache\\.A\\MsBuild.Corext.sE2FwIuT0zUvdE9g6wU5UA\\Environment.props (36,3)\". This is most likely a build authoring error. This subsequent import will be ignored. [D:\\code\\CorextExe\\src\\Common\\Common.csproj]\tCommon\tD:\\CorextCache\\.A\\MsBuild.Corext.sE2FwIuT0zUvdE9g6wU5UA\\Environment.props\t36\t\r\n`\r\nWhere the code loading that task is essentially:\r\n`  <Import Project=\"$(MsBuildExtensionsPath)\\Plugin\\Props\\*\" />`\r\n\r\nThere is only one file in the Props folder, and if I remove the wildcard and import only that file it works fine.  More interesting is that changing the property used to root it to something else, or using a hardcoded path at the beginning lets it work fine with wildcards.  For instance\r\n\r\n`  <Import Project=\"$(AnyOtherProperty)\\Extensions\\Plugin\\Props\\*\" />`\r\n\r\nIt seems there is special logic around the variable MsBuildExtensionsPath causing msbuild/VS to get confused over wildcard imports such that it thinks it has to import twice from this specific line.",
