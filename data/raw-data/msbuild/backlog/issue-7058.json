  "title": "Use of NuGet static-graph restore introduces prebuilts in source-build",
  "body": "This is related to the use of the `RestoreUseStaticGraphEvaluation` option which was added in https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6905.  This option does not appear to work well with the [`MSBuild.SourceBuild.slnf`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/MSBuild.SourceBuild.slnf).  All of the projects in the main solution appear to get restored instead of only the ones in the filter.  Therefore msbuild has numerous prebuilts coming from various projects that are intended to be excluded from source-build.\r\n\r\n[source-build msbuild binlog](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/7582838/2.xx.sourcebuild.zip)\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/2626\r\n\r\n",
