  "body": "### Summary\n\nAdd [`JoinItems`](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/JoinItems.cs) task that's currently defined in .NET SDK to msbuild as an officially supported task.\r\n\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nJoining items is generally useful operation that should be provided by msbuild.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nThe current implementation as provided in .NET SDK, maybe add extra parameters to customize the join (inner join vs left/right outer join).\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "For any task that will be a 'public' task, the following questions should probably have answers.\r\n\r\n- Is the task providing something that is not otherwise available?\r\n- Is the task general-purpose?\r\n\r\nA task is not needed to perform many types of joins with Item collections.\r\n\r\nFor me, this raises the question - why does this task exist? What was the purpose and motivation for creating the `JoinItems` task originally? I hope that it is not the case that a task was written instead of understanding how to join in MSBuild.\r\n\r\nIf the functionality of `JoinItems` is redundant, that doesn't necessarily break the case for adding the task. Performance and/or simplicity have value.\r\n\r\nThe [`FormatUrl`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/formaturl-task?view=vs-2022) task is not a general purpose task. I'm guessing `FormatUrl` was created for a specific internal need. In its current form, it should not have been exposed as a 'public' task. That can't be undone at this point. (The lack of a true general-purpose task for URIs is part of why I proposed #8613.) But the situation of `FormatUrl` should not be repeated.\r\n\r\nFrom my own quick review, `JoinItems` seems general-purpose and would not create an issue like `FormatUrl`.\r\n\r\nIndependently I have noodled with creating a similar task wrapping `IEnumerable<ITaskItem>.Join()` and `IEnumerable<ITaskItem>Group.Join()`. I can share details and code if there is interest.",
