  "title": "[Bug]: dotnet test does not report failed test(s) information if terminal logger disabled",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIf the terminal logger is disabled (e.g. when running in CI in GitHub Actions) and a test fails, no visible output about the state of the test run is output to the console. Only an error code of 1 is returned: [example](https://github.com/martincostello/openapi-extensions/actions/runs/10970728924/job/30465146315#step:4:42)\r\n\r\nThe user has to depend on an additional logger (such as GitHubActionsTestLogger) to see [which tests failed and why](https://github.com/martincostello/openapi-extensions/actions/runs/10970728924#summary-30465146315), or has to re-run the tests locally with the terminal logger enabled to see what the failure is (which is problematic for CI-only failures).\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nTo repro the exact failure above locally:\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/martincostello/openapi-extensions/pull/103/commits/0a12b92320d59954193a4ef067baedbfd974bfb6\r\n2. Edit `build.ps1` to add `--tl:off` ([code](https://github.com/martincostello/openapi-extensions/blob/0a12b92320d59954193a4ef067baedbfd974bfb6/build.ps1#L84))\r\n3. Run `build.ps1`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, run `dotnet test --tl:off` for a test suite using the latest .NET 9 RC2 build where one of the tests fails.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSome sort of message showing what tests failed is printed to the console. Ideally this would be similar to .NET 8's output modulo any improvements to the output of the total test counts etc.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNothing is emitted that gives a hint as to whether tests are being run, or what the outcome was.\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nA hunch tells me this has regressed at some point since preview 7.\r\n\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nI can repro this with both `9.0.100-rc.1.24452.12` and `9.0.100-rc.2.24468.2` (a build from the last 24 hours).\r\n",
