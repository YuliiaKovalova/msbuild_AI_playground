  "title": "Do not require satellite assembly for neutral language for Release builds",
  "body": "Currently we force all languages, even the neutral language (English) to load for satellite assemblies. This helped us catch a couple of bugs :)\n\nHowever, on Release builds, it would be nice to not require satellites for English. This way, we can omit copying the English satellites for English only usages (e.g., internal build labs, etc).\n\nDebug builds should still use the current behaviour of requiring satellites for all languages so we can catch bugs.\n",
