What's the default unit if no unit is supplied on the --memory flag as is done in the original example \"--memory 9072\"?  If the default is bytes or kilobytes such that this is either 9K or 9MB, I could certainly imagine that being too little such that various things could go wrong.",

I have tried setting `EnableDefaultContentItems` to false and manually including `<Content Include=\"wwwroot\\**\">` and I get the same error from a different source.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/share/dotnet/sdk/2.0.0/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(4436,5): warning MSB3026: Could not copy \"/src/My/Web/App/wwwroot/lib/jquery/AUTHORS.txt\" to \"bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/wwwroot/lib/jquery/AUTHORS.txt\".

In both cases, the parent of the destination `wwwroot` directories exist (i.e., the bin/Release/... directory), but the `wwwroot` directory itself does not exist. All directories are marked as root so it doesn't appear to be a permissions issue.",
