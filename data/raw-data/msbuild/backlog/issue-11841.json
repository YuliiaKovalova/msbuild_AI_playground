  "body": "I'm encountering the following warning during C++ project builds in Visual Studio 2022 (v17.0, toolset v143):\n\n`warning MSB4211: The property \"GetTargetPathDependsOn\" is being set to a value for the first time, but it was already consumed at \"Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\".`\nAfter inspecting the preprocessed MSBuild output (msbuild /pp), I confirmed that:\n- GetTargetPathDependsOn is used in Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\n- It is set later in Microsoft.CppBuild.targets\n\nThis appears to be a sequencing issue in the order of imports or property evaluation.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Environment:\n- Visual Studio 2022 Professional\n- MSBuild v17.0\n- C++ project (.vcxproj)\n- PlatformToolset: v143\n\n\u2753 Expected behavior: No warning should be emitted if the property is used and set in a consistent and expected order by the MSBuild system itself.\n\n\u2705 Workaround: Suppressing the warning via:\n`<PropertyGroup>\n  <MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>MSB4211</MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>\n</PropertyGroup>\n`\n\nBut ideally, this should be resolved in the targets themselves.",
