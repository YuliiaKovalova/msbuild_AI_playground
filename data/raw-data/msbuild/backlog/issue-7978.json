Ensure it does not include any information you don't want to be public before you attach one.\r\nIf you want to share one just with Microsoft, you can [report a problem through Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report) and share it privately with Microsoft.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n- Open project in VS 2022 preview\r\n- execute Solution build so that the csproj that contains NPM commands will generate the Angular 14 build files\r\n- Wait for build to finish\r\n- Check bin folder\r\n\r\nI tried this sample below and changed the <targetframework> value of it to net6.0 and just removed the target named \"CopyPartials\" from the csproj upon pulling the source code:\r\nhttps://github.com/AlahmadiQ8/RazorPagesAngular\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\nAngular 14 build files to be included on ASP.NET Razor Pages build files\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\nAngular 14 build files not included on ASP.NET Razor Pages build files and only sees JSON files on the BIN folder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\nI don't know where the fault is. its beyond my knowledge\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n",
