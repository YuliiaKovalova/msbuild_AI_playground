Compile solution successfully\r\n2. Delete .pdb file in Debug/Release folder\r\n3. Press 'Ctrl+Shift+B', it recompiles al cpp files again\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The expected output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\nIt should re-link again without compiling.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--\r\n* The actual output or behavior.\r\n-->\r\nIt re-compiles all cpp files including stdafx.cpp, etc.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n<!--\r\n* If you have an idea where the problem might lie, let us know that here.\r\n* Please include any pointers to code, relevant changes, or related issues you know of.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n<!--\r\n* In a Visual Studio developer command prompt, run `msbuild -version` and paste the output here.\r\n* If applicable, include the version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\n\r\n* Post any other relevant configuration settings here.\r\n*   OS, architecture, etc.\r\n-->\r\n16.9.0.16703\r\n\r\n### Attach a binlog\r\n<!--\r\n* If providing us a project that reproduces the issue proves difficult, consider including a binlog.\r\n* Click [here](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog) for details on sharing binary logs.\r\n* Click [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md) for more information on binary logs.\r\n    NOTE: Binlogs can contain sensitive information. Don't attach anything you don't want to be public.\r\n\r\n*   To view the contents of the binlogs yourself, you may wish to use a tool like https://msbuildlog.com/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI cannot use 16.10 at this moment, do you know which previous version don't have this issue?\r\n",

It was moved from `microsoft/msbuild` to make some of the .NET release process stuff easier.\r\n\r\nTeam triage: However, this issue is about incremental build in C++ scenarios, and the code for that is not in this repo (it's in the internal Visual Studio codebase). Can you please [open a feedback ticket instead](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/feedback-options)? Please post the link here and we can help expedite routing.\r\n",
