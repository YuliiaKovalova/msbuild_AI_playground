        "body": "That's a good question. I don't think the `.overridetasks` file is necessary, but I don't understand why it exists at all. \r\n\r\nThe original commit notes were (10/14/2008 7:54 AM)\r\n\r\n> Changeset 598865: Override tasks are required to allow msbuild 4.0 to target framework version 3.5 and lower when the toolset being used is 3.5 or lower. The reason is, when targeting .net 3.5 or lower we need to use out of process tasks. The .net 3.5 and 2.0 generate resoruce and resolve com reference tasks do in process work. We have updated the 4.0 tasks to do out of process work. The problem was, we need to be able to tell the 3.5 and 2.0 toolsets to use the 4.0 task rather than that tasks which shipped.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I buy that logic.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, can you just _add_ to the .override tasks file?",

        "body": "> can you just add to the .override tasks file?\r\n\r\nI am using Gentoo Linux, and it is inconvenient to modify files during package installation (and modify back during deinstallation). The best design here is to have the folder for configuration files and define the load order for them. Files should be loaded in that order and next files should redefine directives form previously loaded files.\r\nSpecifically, I want to redefine ResolveAssemblyReference task to take {PkgConfig} into account - https://github.com/gentoo/dotnet/issues/379",
