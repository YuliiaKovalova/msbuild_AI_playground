Setting PublishDir to a solution specific path ensured that the folder was not cleared.\r\n\r\nIt's a major breaking change which is now breaking our local rebuilds that the `ClickOncePublishDir` folder is suddenly being removed completely on `Clean` target.  (`ClickOncePublishDir == PublishDir` by default.) \r\n",
