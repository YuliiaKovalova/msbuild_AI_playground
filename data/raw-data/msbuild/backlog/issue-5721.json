Library/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert.csproj\r\n\r\nThe resulting `nupkg` only contains the definitions for the UWP target.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/MintPlayer/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert\r\n    cd MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert\r\n    msbuild /t:Restore\r\n    msbuild /t:Pack /p:Configuration=Debug /p:PackageVersion=1.0.0 Library/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert.csproj\r\n    msbuild /t:Pack /p:Configuration=Debug /p:OutputPath=../.. /p:PackageVersion=1.0.1 Library/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert/MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert.csproj\r\n    copy Library\\MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert\\bin\\Debug\\MintPlayer.Xamarin.Alert.1.0.0.nupkg .\r\n    dotnet nuget add source %cd% --name TestPackages\r\n\r\nNow you can install version 1.0.0 (the one built with outputpath) or version 1.0.1 (the one built without outputpath) in a xamarin.forms project.\r\n\r\nAll targets for version 1.0.0 only contain the UWP declarations, The targets for version 1.0.1 contain the declarations for the dedicate target.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nSpecifying the outputpath should also pack all target dll's in the nuget package.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nInstalling the nuget package in Android, iOS and UWP projects only makes the UWP declarations available for all platforms.",

        "body": "Team Triage: It looks like you're setting `OutputPath` as a global property. As a result, it will apply to every project, including the different target frameworks for your library. In general, It's not safe to pass `OutputPath` on the command line. You might want to specify `OutputPath` within a `Directory.Build.targets` file based on a new property that you define and specify that on the command line. Note you should have a default assignment for this property.\r\n\r\nIf you're still having this issue, feel free to comment here.",
