  "body": "### Summary\n\nIt'd be great if we could scan for some patterns where a property (that we know about) is set instead as item metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\n\"Things\" in MSBuild are properties, items, or metadata on specific items. But if you hear \"set X\", it's hard to know which category X is in, and easy to make mistakes.\n\n### Sample issue or antipattern that the check should be flagging\n\nAn anonymous dev hit some trouble with a NuGet package and tried to fix it by doing this\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent\" Version=\"3.1.13\" >\r\n      <CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>\r\n    </PackageReference>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks convincing! But it's wrong, because `CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies` is a _project property_, not a per-package setting. Sure would be nice if MSBuild could help.\n\n### Sample output\n\n_No response_",
