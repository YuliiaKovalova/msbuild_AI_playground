That does seem reasonable (though it'd have to go into `ITaskItem3`, which is unfortunate).\n",

You can (in the [current implementation](https://github.com/rainersigwald/msbuild/blob/6fef01a8683f76a52d0a379bc12e5ee02d15b990/src/Shared/TaskParameter.cs#L676-L698)) cast that to `Dictionary<string, string>` and walk over _that_ instead.\n",
