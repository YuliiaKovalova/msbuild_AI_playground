  "body": "## Motivation\r\n\r\n#8400 needs code crawling and investigation to detect all places that needs build events editing, test if the data spill somewhere and whats the perf impact.\r\nPrototype should be based on the doc: #8401\r\n\r\n## Expected outputs\r\n- Prototype of build events redacting\r\n- Perf measurements of impact on small (new console) and larger (orchard) buids\r\n- The prototype can have the data preselection (what properties, items, metadata to redact) hardcoded\r\n- If possible create few options - ignoring or honoring the values transformation/flattening/etc.",
