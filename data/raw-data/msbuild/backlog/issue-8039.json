  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft.NET.StringTools 17.3.0 and 17.3.1 versions regress from 1.0.0 by adding a `ref` folder that includes `netstandard2.0`, yet no `lib` subfolder that satisfies netcoreapp3.1. \r\n\r\nIt's a wonder that nuget restore doesn't warn that my netcoreapp3.1 project won't have the runtime assembly that it requires.\r\n\r\nA `lib\\netstandard2.0` or `lib\\netcoreapp3.1` folder should be added to the package.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Build a netcoreapp3.1 console or test project.\r\n2. Add a PackageReference to Microsoft.NET.StringTools 17.3.1.\r\n3. Add a bit of code that requires that assembly at runtime.\r\n4. Run the program.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe program succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe program fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Message:\u2009\r\nSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException : Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.NET.StringTools, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.

        "body": "I've seen preview builds of the 17.4.0 version of this package, and the problem gets worse. Once again, the `ref\\netstandard2.0` folder exists, suggesting this library should work on any netstandard2.0 runtime. But with this latest version, even the `lib\\net6.0` folder is dropped, thereby requiring `net7.0` to actually use the library.  \r\n\r\n.NET Framework 3.5 and 4.7.2 builds are also supplied, so clearly this library should be expected to work on netcoreapp3.1 and net6.0. Why did the runtime assemblies for these runtimes get dropped?",
