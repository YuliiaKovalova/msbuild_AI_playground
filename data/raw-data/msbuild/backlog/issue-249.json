  "body": "This test is expected to return the string `\"A;B;C;D\"` but actually returns `\"System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.String]\"`.  Clearly we've changed something to cause a`List<string>`to not get flattened, but it's not immediately obvious where.  I was suspicious of changes from 1da7bfd to`Expander`, but since the test fails on both full-framework and Core, that doesn't appear to be the problem.\n",
