        "body": " Investigation: We have ~3 times more metadata to process, as we found out in #6062. And the epic itself shows 3 times difference. This huge multiplicity factor (5x) seems as a fluke to me. I performed additional measurements for this function and on my dev machine got 2142 msec (netcore) and 651 msec (netframework) in average. Which gives us multiplicity factor ~3.2. \r\nCode changes: Similar to issue #6062, there were some minor changes that we can do to this function. We have already done them (together with changes for #6062) in PR #6529.\r\n",
