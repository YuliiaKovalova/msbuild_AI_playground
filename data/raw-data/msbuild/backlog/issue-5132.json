        "body": "This seems to primarily be a problem if someone wants to rename a file to have 3+ dots when it didn't originally, since VS doesn't allow someone to make a new solution with three consecutive dots in its name, and although `dotnet sln` does, it doesn't allow you to add projects to a sln with three dots.\r\n\r\nWhen building, however, this should still work, and it doesn't. I believe the problem is [here](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L1880). Specifically, according to the comment, we used to use GetFileListEscaped, which would not only handle escaping properly but also expand globs. The new version (with `EscapingUtilities.UnescapeAll`) handles escaping but does not expand globs, which causes the error lucipurrr reported.\r\n\r\nSince it would be best to copy what VS does as far as what are acceptable names, I created an issue in the sdk as well [here](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/10700).",
