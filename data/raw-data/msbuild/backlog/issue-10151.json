  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nMSBuild's diagnostic logging `-v:diagnostic`  should record whether long paths are enabled.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nmsbuild.exe supports long paths on Windows since 16.0 https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/releases/tag/v16.0.461.62831\r\n\r\n> MSBuild.exe now supports long paths on Windows\r\n\r\nHowever Windows users have to *additionally* opt in by setting a registry key/ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later\r\n\r\n> Starting in Windows 10, version 1607, MAX_PATH limitations have been removed from common Win32 file and directory functions. However, you must opt-in to the new behavior. ... The registry key Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem\\LongPathsEnabled (Type: REG_DWORD) must exist and be set to 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nMSBuild's diagnostic logging `-v:diagnostic` includes an \"environment at start of build section\". This should record whether long paths are enabled in Windows.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n_No response_",
