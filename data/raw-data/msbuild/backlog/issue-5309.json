  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a project file like this:\r\n\r\nProject file\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard1.1</TargetFramework>\r\n    <IncludeBuildOutput>false</IncludeBuildOutput>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n\r\n```\r\nPack it with:\r\n\r\nCommand line\r\n```\r\ndotnet pack\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe resulting package has no dependency to NetStandard, because I don't include the build output. I would expect a package that can be installed standalone... without any dependency.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe package has a dependency to NetStandard\r\n\r\n\r\n",
