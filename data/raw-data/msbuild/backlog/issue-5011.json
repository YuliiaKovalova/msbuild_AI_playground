  "body": "I have a solution with the following structure:\r\n```\r\n --repo root\r\n    |solution1.sln\r\n    |Directory.Build.props\r\n    |src\r\n       |project1\r\n       | project1.test\r\n```\r\n       \r\nThe file `Directory.Build.props` include the property `SolutionDir`:\r\n```xml   \r\n<SolutionDir Condition=\"'$(SolutionDir)'==''\">$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)</SolutionDir> \r\n```\r\nThen i reference files in the project as:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n\t\t<None Include=\"$(SolutionDir)LICENSE.md\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"\"/>\t\t\r\n\t</ItemGroup>\r\n ```\r\nThat is working fine.\r\n \r\nin a new solution2.sln in other folder, I referenced project1 with its own Directory.Build.props \r\nWhen building using dotnet build, I get the error message:\r\n\r\n>   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\Sdks\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack\\buildCrossTargeting\\NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets(198,5)\r\nerror NU5019: File not found: 'F:\\experiment\\LICENSE.md'. [F:\\project1\\src\\project1\\project1.csproj]\r\n\r\nTo trace the value of $(SolutionDir), I add the following code in project1.csproj:\r\n```xml\t\r\n\t<Target Name=\"ShowMsgs\" AfterTargets=\"Build\">\r\n\t\t<Message Text=\"SolutionDir: $(SolutionDir)\" Importance=\"High\"/>\r\n\t</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect to show the project1 solution folder, but I was surprised it  shows the current solution folder. \r\n```\r\nSolutionDir: F:\\experiment\\\r\n```\r\nIt seems that $(SolutionDir) is evaluated w.r.t the last solution folder not to its Directory.Build.props file.\r\n\r\nHow to enforce msbuild to evaluate $(SolutionDir) to $(MSBuildThisFileDirectory) in  its Directory.Build.props?\r\n \r\n Edit:\r\nI renamed the property to: SolutionDirectory and it's working fine.\r\nThe SolutionDir is reserved (although it's not documented) and its value is the current solution\r\n          ",
