  "body": "When you publish an app through VS (at least in some paths), it writes a FolderProfile.pubxml. I guess it is imported into the build. If you open that to look at it or edit it you will get a warning in VS\r\n```\r\nSeverity\tCode\tDescription\tProject\tFile\tLine\tSuppression State\r\nWarning\t\tThe element 'PropertyGroup' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003' has invalid child element 'PublishDir' in namespace 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003'.

They get to see the list of valid values out of the box + a little description that explains how to setup the value correctly.\r\n\r\nThen all the advanced users who are off the beaten path will avoid getting errors / warnings because of #2.",
