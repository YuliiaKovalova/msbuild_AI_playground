The only remedy is to wait. I often have to wait 1 - 2 minutes before attempting another build. VS evidently holds onto files for a very long time past the end of the build process. Holding onto that file causes the VS build process to fail next time. VS will success in building if I wait 1 - 2 minutes.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 11/16/2023, 04:02 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Ray White on 11/22/2023, 04:25 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)",

An external app may have locked these files, which cause builds to fail. I have no direct proof of this, but that\u2019s my \u201cgut feeling\u201d on the matter. I have marked this as a \u201cSolution\u201d until I prove otherwise. Only time will tell.\r\n\r\nI experienced the same issue and was able to fix it only by moving the project outside of my synced directory with Google Drive. Seems, in my case, Google Drive app (desktop) was the culprit.",
