[C:\\source\\msbuild\\src\\Framework\\Microsoft.Build.Framework.csproj]\r\n    Input file \"C:\\source\\msbuild\\artifacts\\obj\\Microsoft.Build.Framework\\Microsoft.Build.Framework.csproj.nuget.g.targets\" is newer than output file \"C:\\source\\msbuild\\artifacts\\obj\\Microsoft.Build.Framework\\Debug\\net472\\Microsoft.Build.Framework.dll.config\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis:\r\nThe Target's output isn't updated because the GenerateBindingRedirects task will skip writing to the output if the content are the same.\r\n\r\n### Possible Fix:\r\nRemove both the target's Inputs and Outputs parameter.\r\nOr remove the \"$(MSBuildAllProjects)\" from the Inputs.",

        "body": "Ran into the same thing, broken incrementality because the GenerateBindingRedirects task is smart, and it won't touch the output file if the contents didn't change. However if you have an input that changed, but didn't influence the contents of the output file, you get stuck (since the output file continues to be older than the input that has changed).\r\n\r\nI think this is a general problem where if a target declares inputs and outputs, and the task inside it doesn't rewrite the outputs if they haven't changed, you'll have this problem. Not sure if it has an official name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps always touch the output file and rely on the Inputs/Outputs mechanism? But the problem is if any of the reference dlls have changed, you probably want to recompute binding redirects, since it's impossible to capture all inputs of RAR in the Inputs of the target.\r\n\r\nI also notice there's the $(SuggestedBindingRedirectsCacheFile) and the _GenerateSuggestedBindingRedirectsCache target, perhaps there's something more sophisticated going on?",
