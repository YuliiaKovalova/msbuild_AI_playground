  "title": "[Feature Request]: Warns a user if they use Restore as an explicit target (/t:Restore;Build) instead of the /restore flag",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nWe should warn users when they use the Restore target specifically (`-t:Restore`) instead of `/restore` during a build - this is _very often_ a mistake and we should point users to the correct version.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nUsers of the new CLI-based MSBuild property/item syntax often run into issues with uninitialized repositories, so they add `-t:Restore` and then wonder why their tooling only works after the first run. This is the core reason, and we should guide them to using the switch.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nWhen\r\n\r\n* Restore is part of the targets list, and\r\n* a project contains NuGet packages, and\r\n* a nuget dependency file was created during the build\r\n* then issue a warning so the user knows they should use /restore instead of /t:Restore\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "This is in the description but to be super clear: running _just_ `/t:Restore` is ok; the problem is when you `/t:Restore;Build` (or similar), because of XML caches that may give the `Build` part a stale view of NuGet-generated MSBuild targets files.",
