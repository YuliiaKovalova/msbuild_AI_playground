        "body": "All the tests that are not marked with [Ignore] should be working. There are quite a few I had to disable migrating it out of our internal environment though. Most of those are tagged with a comment like `// Ignore: Test requires installed toolset.`. Ideally all the tests should be enabled (or deleted if they don't apply anymore), so we are definitely open to PR for fixes there :).\n\nThe biggest difficulty was that the tests often targeted the version of MSBuild that is installed on your machine in the GAC. We had a cmd file to update the machine so that you would be (hopefully) testing what you just built and not the retail version, but this is definitely not ideal. This has been around and not changed for ages, so we couldn't get to all of them. And without doing some sort of [signing](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/wiki/Microsoft.Build.Framework) that method doesn't work anyway.\n\nIf you do have specific issues I'd like to see more information and if it repros running the test by itself or not. The machine I used for the majority of the testing was Windows 10 Server (9926) and Visual Studio 2015 (CTP6).\n",
