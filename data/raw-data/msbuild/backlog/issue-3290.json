  "title": "Microsoft.CodeAnalysis fails to load on `dotnet build` in a custom MSBuild task",
  "body": "moved from https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/26569 on behalf of @pbalaga \r\n\r\n**Version Used**: \r\n[Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 2.8.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/)\r\n\r\n`dotnet --info`:\r\n```\r\n.NET Command Line Tools (2.1.105)\r\n\r\nProduct Information:\r\n Version:            2.1.105\r\n Commit SHA-1 hash:  141cc8d976\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.16299\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.105\\\r\n\r\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\r\n\r\n  Version  : 2.0.7\r\n  Build    : 2d61d0b043915bc948ebf98836fefe9ba942be11\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/pbalaga/TaskWithCodeAnalysisFailure.git`\r\n2. `cd TaskWithCodeAnalysisFailure\\TaskConsumerProject`\r\n3. `dotnet build`\r\n\r\nImportant points about how the above repro repository was built:\r\n- TaskLibrary.csproj\r\n  * define a custom MsBuild task: `SampleTask`\r\n  * `<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>` in order to copy NuGet references to bin folder\r\n- TaskConsumerProject.csproj\r\n  * invoke SampleTask from TaskLibrary's bin folder:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<UsingTask TaskName=\"TaskLibrary.SampleTask\" AssemblyFile=\"..\\TaskLibrary\\bin\\Debug\\netstandard2.0\\TaskLibrary.dll\" />\r\n<Target Name=\"SampleTaskInvocation\" BeforeTargets=\"Build\">\r\n    <SampleTask></SampleTask>\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nProject should build without errors.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nBuild fails with the below error:\r\n>TaskConsumerProject\\TaskConsumerProject.csproj(11,5): error MSB4018: System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Version=2.8.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'. Could not find or load a specific file. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131621)\r\n\r\n**Remarks**:\r\n- the same project builds without errors in Visual Studio 2017 and via MsBuild CLI\r\n- commenting out [the line](https://github.com/pbalaga/TaskWithCodeAnalysisFailure/blob/1f440e36f2ca0648d3b7624fefb03a173ea947d0/TaskLibrary/Task.cs#L11) containing Microsoft.CodeAnalysis usage makes the problem disappear\r\n- all projects are targeting netstandard2.0, no multi-targeting (so not the same issue as https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/7510)\r\n- I managed to attach a debugger to `SampleTask` before it throws an exception, but there is no more detail presented than in console output\r\n- two additional dependencies were added to `SampleTask`: a project dependency and a NuGet dependency on a package different than Microsoft.CodeAnalysis to rule out possibility that this is a more general `dotnet`'s problem with dependency resolution. Only using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis causes the build to fail\r\n- I tried other versions of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, specifically: `2.8.0-beta4` and `2.7.0`, both of which produce exactly the same results",
