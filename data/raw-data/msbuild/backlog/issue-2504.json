  "body": "When implementing https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/pull/2414, I was not able to find a way to clear the configuration cache between builds.  The result of this is that memory will not be freed between builds.  The loaded configurations will never be re-used because they contain a property that is a GUID.  When experimenting with clearing the configuration cache, MSBuild hangs after building the first project after restore.",
