  "title": "dotnet restore: Ambiguous project name",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI have an application that I want to brand by overwriting the AssemblyName. Now if the .exe gets the same name as a dll msbuild restore will fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet restore\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.401\\NuGet.targets(132,5): error : Ambiguous project name 'b'. \r\n\r\n```\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n* Unzip the sample [dotnetrestore-issue.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/9721988/dotnetrestore-issue.zip)\r\n\r\n* Go into the directory of the sln\r\n* Execute dotnet restore: You will see that it works flawlessly\r\n* Now override the MsBuild property `BrandingAssemblyName` by the name of the dll (powershell: $env:BrandingAssemblyName=\"b\")\r\n* Again execute dotnet restore: You will see the error reported above\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nMy usecase is that I want to extend my application `a.exe` with the functionality of a plugin `b.dll` and brand the application as `b.exe`. \r\n\r\nThis will be the directory structure \r\n```\r\nb.exe\r\nPlugins/b/b.dll\r\n```\r\nSo the binaries will not get in their way\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe error mentioned above\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe MsBuild RestoreTask seems to not take into account the extension, just the assemblyname. So it believes there is an ambiguity of b.exe and b.dll but they are differentiable by extension.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\ndotnet --version\r\n6.0.401\r\n\r\nI only use dotnet build from non-developer powershell. But for completeness this is the msbuild version extracted from the developer console from VS 2022 (Version 17.3.0)\r\nmsbuild -version\r\nMSBuild version 17.3.0+f67e3d35e for .NET Framework\r\n17.3.0.37102",
