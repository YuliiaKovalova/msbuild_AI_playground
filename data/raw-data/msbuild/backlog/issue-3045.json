When authoring some of them I found that, [in the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-reserved-and-well-known-properties), `MSBuildExtensionsPath` should not have `\\` backslash at the end. So, my and possibly others' targets use it like this: `$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)SomeFolder\\SomeBuildProcess.targets`.\r\n\r\nWhen those targets gets shared, let's say, by using `msbuild.exe` instead of `dotnet (ms)build` it breaks the build process, since the path becomes like this: `C:\\Program Files\\MSBuildSomeFolder\\SomeBuildProcess.targets`.\r\n\r\nBasically, this a **huge behavioral change**, sure people are not directly using `MSBuildExtensionsPath` anymore, but I've seen code in wild, that leads to many build problems, especially for new people familiarizing with `dotnet msbuild` and authoring custom sdks!",
