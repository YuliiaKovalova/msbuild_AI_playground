  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe syntax to just include files files in an output package seems overly complicated for such a simple task.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCurrently we have to remove the files from the `<None>` and add them to `<Content>` which is not enough as we also need to add a `<CopyToOutputDirectory>`. With out the latter, Content just does nothing.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Remove=\"MailTemplates\\*.hbs\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <Content Include=\"MailTemplates\\*.hbs\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </Content>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nWe expect something as simple as that (or similar) to just work.\r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n      <Content Include=\"MailTemplates\\*.hbs\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output: 15.6.82.30579\r\n\r\nOS info: Windows 10\r\n\r\nIf applicable, version of the tool that invokes MSBuild (Visual Studio, dotnet CLI, etc):\r\ndotnet cli: 2.1.102\r\n",
