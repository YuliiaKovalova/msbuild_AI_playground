        "body": "It is probably an expected outcome of changing the default logger. `/clp:PerformanceSummary` is the _console logger parameter_ and the terminal logger is now used instead of the console logger, and it has different parameters set. We should consider adding a _terminal logger parameter_ `/tlp:PerformanceSummary` that allows to show the performance summary. Or maybe we shall make `PerformanceSummary` a build parameter? @baronfel",
