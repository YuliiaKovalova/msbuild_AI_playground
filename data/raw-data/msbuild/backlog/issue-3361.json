  "title": "Misleading license header in MSBuildTasks.h in repo",
  "body": "The MSBuildTasks.h file (https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/Tasks/MSBuildTasks.h) has a license header that looks a bit weird:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n//\r\n// Copyright (C) 2015 Microsoft Corporation,\r\n// All rights reserved\r\n//\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to imply (with the \"all rights reserved\", and no license note) that this file is not open source. Would it  be possible to switch to the format used by other files in this repository? For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n// Copyright (c) Microsoft. All rights reserved.\r\n// Licensed under the MIT license. See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(From https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/xplat/src/Tasks/AssemblyRemapping.cs). Or some header that is more consistent with the main LICENSE file in the repository? This would address my concerns. Thanks!\r\n",
