  "title": "GetPathOfFileAbove doesn't work as advertised by finding file in same directory",
  "body": "The `GetPathOfFileAbove` property function is great, but its name includes *Above*, suggesting it won't file the path to a file at the same directory.\r\n\r\nIn fact [the documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/property-functions?view=vs-2022#msbuild-property-functions) supports this interpretation, as it says in the table of property functions:\r\n\r\n> Searches for and returns the full path to a file in the directory structure _above the current build file's location_, or based on startingDirectory, if specified.\r\n\r\nThough [lower](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/property-functions?view=vs-2022#msbuild-getpathoffileabove) in that same doc, the function is correctly documented (as in, the docs match behavior):\r\n\r\n> searches upward for a directory containing the specified file, beginning in (and including) the specified directory... By default, the search will start in the current file's own directory.\r\n\r\nI fully expect that it's too late to change this function's behavior, but perhaps we should fix the documentation, at least?",
