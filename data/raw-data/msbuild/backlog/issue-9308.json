  "title": "[Bug]: OverflowException in BinaryLogger",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI was using the binary logger on a very large set of projects and saw this error:\n\n```\nMSBUILD : error MSB4015: The build stopped unexpectedly because the \"ReusableLogger\" logger failed unexpectedly during shutdown.\nSystem.OverflowException: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.\n   at System.IO.BufferedStream.Write(Byte[] array, Int32 offset, Int32 count)\n   at Microsoft.Build.Logging.BuildEventArgsWriter.WriteBlob(BinaryLogRecordKind kind, Byte[] bytes)\n   at Microsoft.Build.Logging.BinaryLogger.Shutdown()\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.ShutdownLogger(ILogger logger)\n```\n\nThis caused the build to fail.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nI'd imagine its hard to reproduce this but I'm sure we can create a unit test that would create the circumstances that leads to the exception.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nA failure in the binary logger should not cause the build to fail.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nMSBuild can either use a large type for numbers or guard against unexpected failures in the binary logger and log a warning instead of failing the build.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n```\nMSBuild version 17.6.3+07e294721 for .NET Framework\n17.6.3.22601\n```",

But I was wondering if you might get there due to some other error (e.g. accidently including binary files)",
