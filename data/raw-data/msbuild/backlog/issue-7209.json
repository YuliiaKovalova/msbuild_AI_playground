  "title": "dotnet build hang and running dotnet.exe processes cannot be killed",
  "body": "### The bug\r\nThis is similar to https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/9487, but i believe it's not exactly the same.\r\nWith NET 6.0.100, the build often hang and there is no way to kill the *dotnet.exe* left behind.\r\nI also cannot inspect or create a dump of the hanging process (even with admin privileges), since I receive \"access denied\" error messages.\r\n\r\n**The real problem is that *dotnet.exe* lock files, which cannot be freed in any way.\r\nOnce this happens, the only solution is to reboot Windows.**\r\n\r\n### Tried and failed workarounds\r\n\r\nIt's unclear to me the root cause, and I tried the following workarounds, but without success:\r\n1. Disable any form of multi-process or parallel build (in both Rider and Visual Studio 2019)\r\n2. Added `<UseRazorBuildServer>false</UseRazorBuildServer>` to all my projects using a global *Directory.Build.props* file, as suggested \r\n3. Execute `dotnet build-server shutdown` (with admin privileges)\r\n4. Killing the hanging processess. As you can see, even with admin processess, it doesn't work\r\n```\r\nC:\\Windows\\system32>taskkill /im dotnet.exe /F\r\nERROR: The process \"dotnet.exe\" with PID 19788 could not be terminated.\r\nReason: There is no running instance of the task.\r\nERROR: The process \"dotnet.exe\" with PID 17188 could not be terminated.\r\nReason: There is no running instance of the task.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nIt seems somehow correlated to the presence of Razor components or libraries, but at this point this is more an intuition than a real hypothesis.\r\nSince I don't see a clear pattern, and I cannot provide the sources due to NDA reasons, I can't provide more insights, sorry.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\nThe problem happens with both VS 2019 and Rider.\r\n\r\nThis is the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   6.0.100\r\n Commit:    9e8b04bbff\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19042\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 6.0.0\r\n  Commit:  4822e3c3aa\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  2.2.207 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.408 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.202 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.403 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  6.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.30 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.2.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.30 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.2.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.30 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.8 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.14 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the few infos I could get.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5829421/141671039-2fc1f833-b264-4e34-987b-7717db725140.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5829421/141671823-d0a9d155-db5a-4fec-b2ec-9ad358fa265b.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5829421/141671841-1859c48c-b22f-4ebc-b844-c183c740bb7b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5829421/141671830-bf200083-aaa9-4c2e-98bf-df82ad7fbe7e.png)\r\n",
