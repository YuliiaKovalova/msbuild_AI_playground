  "body": "When working with an ItemGroup on Linux one can get a fully qualified path to a resource via `@(IG->'%(Directory)')`. This results in a rooted path e.g. `/path/to/my/item`.\n\nOn Windows, the same expression would result in `path\\to\\my\\item` without the leading drive qualifier, therefore providing a non-fully-qualified path to a resource. Obtaining a fully qualified path on Windows requires `@(IG->'%(RootDir)%(Directory)')`.\n\nI'm not familiar with the intention of `%(Directory)` omitting the drive specifier, but the discrepancy was a bit jarring when building a build script on OS X and expecting it to work. I'm fairly familiar with MSBuild so I knew to look at the MSDN documentation for well-known metadata and to identify a fix, but folks less familiar are likely to spend considerable time understanding what went awry. \n\nIt seems that parity might mean that Windows `%(Directory)` values should lead with a `\\` to specify that the path is relative to the drive root, with `%(RootDir)` specifying the drive `X:` only. This should provide an equivalent experience between Windows and non-Windows platforms. If that is not possible because it is a breaking change then we may want to consider also requiring `%(RootDir)` on non-Windows platforms as well so that folks are faced with this challenge consistently across all platforms.\n",

The comment in the source [doesn't explain why](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/70db3602ec75e0e4c50b613eb6588e158d5dfd9f/src/Shared/Modifiers.cs#L359), even though it has to [jump through hoops](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/70db3602ec75e0e4c50b613eb6588e158d5dfd9f/src/Shared/Modifiers.cs#L466-L482) to get that behavior.\n\nI lean toward requiring (or at least allowing) `%(RootDir)` everywhere. I see two options:\n1. Change `Directory` behavior: `RootDir` is always `/`, and `%(Directory)` is always relative, like it is on Windows. This would require `%(RootDir)%(Directory)` on all OSes.\n2. Change `RootDir` behavior: always expand `RootDir` to the empty string, and keep `%(Directory)` as-is. This would allow `%(RootDir)%(Directory)` everywhere, but if you started on *nix you might break when running on Windows.\n",
