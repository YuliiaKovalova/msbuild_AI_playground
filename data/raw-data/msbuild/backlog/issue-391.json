  "body": "I'm using a (Roslyn) Code Analyzer in our projects (per NuGet). \nFor some projects I changed the severity of the analyzer to \"Hidden\" by right click on the analyzer within the solution tree in Visual Studio and choose \"Set Rule Set Severity -> Hidden\". VS creates a new <projectname>.ruleset file for this project. Now all warnings are gone in Visual Studio.\n\nBut when I'm building this solution with MSBuild from command line the warnings still appear.\nIs this a bug? Or how can I disable a particular analyzer that will be honored in VS and MSBuild command line?\n",

        "body": "When you set that setting through VS, is there any change in the MSBuild .csproj file?  Or is the only result the creation of the .ruleset file?  It [looks like](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/compilers/Rule%20Set%20Format.md#msbuild-projects) there should be an addition to the .csproj file (which the Roslyn targets presumably use when calling csc).\n\nI can see a few possibilities as to where the problem is:\n- The `CodeAnalysisRuleSet` property isn't getting set in the project file (problem in VS).\n- The property is getting set, but isn't honored on the command line (problem in the Roslyn C# targets).\n- The property is getting set and used but something's going wrong (problem in MSBuild itself).\n\nThat last option seems pretty unlikely--property propagation is pretty stable.\n",

If you did do a save, then can you also verify that the ruleset property matches your build configuration? The command Set Rule Set Severity sets the CodeAnalysisRuleSet only for Debug and Release configurations, and if you are building for a different config, then the ruleset will not be honored.
