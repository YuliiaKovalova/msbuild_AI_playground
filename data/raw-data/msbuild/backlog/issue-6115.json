  "body": "Original issue: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1251531\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you please add some option to MSBuild to allow us to choose the localization of the output error message ? (ex : environment variable, cli switch, etc)\r\n\r\n \r\nEnglish messages are more easily searchable on the internet and generally have better meaning (French translation is incomprehensible).\r\n\r\n \r\nFor now, choosing localization implies messing up Visual Studio installation files, or cryptic and often unsuccessful change of console code page. (ex https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2286216/how-to-change-msbuild-error-message-language).\r\n\r\n \r\ncl.exe localization works differently (sigh) ; thus we can have mixed English/French messages during a build...\r\n\r\n \r\nIn visual studio, compiler tools locale should be uncorrelated with GUI locale (there is currently only one setting for language in Tools > Options > Environment > International Settings).\r\n\r\n \r\nPlease note that localized messages or not only incomprehensible, they do not integrate well with external tools like Qt and CMake and lead to encoding errors (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-316).",

But we have to make MSBuild lookup localizations every single time and that might be performance and allocation intensive.",
