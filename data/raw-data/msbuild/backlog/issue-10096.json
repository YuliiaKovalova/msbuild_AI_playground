  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nThe pr to support Editorconfig is out https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/9811 and in Review state.\r\nOnce merge I suggest to make it possible to override the file name that is used by the editorconfig parser (now it is .editorconfig)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nMotivation: \r\n\r\n- Make feature more flexible in terms of configuration\r\n- Specification does not require the file name to be \".editorconfig\" but only it's format (https://spec.editorconfig.org/#terminology)\r\n- In case we will face perf regression with already existing large .editorconfigs there will be a possibility to create a file configuring only for BuildCheck infra.  \r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nPropose change: \r\nAdd command line switch: /analyzerConfig with key-value possibility \r\nthe first configuration to be presented is: \r\neditorConfigFileName:\"<filename.anything>\"\r\n\r\n",
