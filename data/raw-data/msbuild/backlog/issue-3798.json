  "body": "Currently we only expose entry points and an unordered list of nodes.\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient to allow API consumers to fetch a node by project file. One wrinkle is that a project make actually have multiple nodes if global properties are different. We'll need to think about how the API looks.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\n```\r\n// Common case is no global props, so make that convenient. This can likely be a O(1) lookup.\r\nProjectGraphNode GetNodeForProject(string projectFile, IDictionary<string, string> globalProperties = null)\r\n\r\n// Gets all nodes matching the project name. This will likely be an O(n) search.\r\nProjectGraphNode[] GetNodesForProject(string projectFile)\r\n```",
