  "body": "Various places in the code have assumptions about the final layout of MSBuild when it's run. For desktop/Full Framework:\n\nA root `bin/` folder contains \n- x86 versions of `MSBuild.exe` and `MSBuildTaskHost.exe`\n- MSIL versions of `Microsoft.Build.dll` and other MSBuild libraries\n- The `amd64/` folder\n\nThe `bin/amd64/` folder has:\n- x64 versions of `MSBuild.exe` and `MSBuildTaskHost.exe`\n\nThis is fine (and hard to change). But the GitHub build produces an entirely different output structure, and the individual-assembly NuGet packages have yet a different approach.\n\nIt would be nice if the usual way to invoke builds just produced the desired final layout.\n",
