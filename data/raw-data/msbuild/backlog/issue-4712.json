All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n15.9.21.664\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dotnet  --version` output:\r\n2.2.107\r\n\r\nI have attempted to change the BeforeTargets to other targets and the same bug persists. This is a simplification of something else I am trying to do -- have an AfterBuild dependency on a \"set up\" target that may or may not exist, depending on whether a NuGet package is installed. The repro above gets at the issue by putting the \"set up\" target and the \"do something\" target in the same project.",
