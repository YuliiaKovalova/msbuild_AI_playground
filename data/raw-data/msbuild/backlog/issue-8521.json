  "body": "Idea by @baronfel\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n#8398 needs investigation of what we can support (and how) in converting between `PackageReference`s and `ProjectReference`s. #8507 is focused on comparing the behavor (and calling out the differences). It would be benefical to understand how prevalent are the usages of specific metadata and hence how important it might be to invest into attampting to unify the behavior of such.\r\n\r\n## Expected outputs\r\n- Leveraging [github api](https://api.github.com/) create prototype code/script to fetch `PackageReference` usages for a nuget given by name in public .net repositories.\r\n- Extract metadata (and their values) used on given `PackageReference`.\r\n- Add simple logic to give a 'weight' to a repo (probably star ranking).\r\n- Produce all data in csv format. Plus create a rollup (summarized weighted usage count per metadata)",
