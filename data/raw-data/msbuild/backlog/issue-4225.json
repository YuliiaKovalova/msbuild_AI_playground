Note that change from `TargetFrameworks` to `TargetFramework` works, as well as calling TextTransform.exe directly.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 15.9.21+g9802d43bc3 for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

The fact that you got it working for a single TFM, as indicated by yourself in your project file, is a HACK.\r\n\r\nNow, this likely does not work for multi-tfm because when the T4 target runs as part of the outer loop, there are no compile items available. You would need to make the target run as part of the inner loop for that to work. However, I haven't tried and am not sure of the details of what would need to happen for this to work.",
