  "title": "[Bug]: Net472 Service Fabric project with .Net 8 project reference broken in latest msbuild",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWith the latest visuals studio update and the latest accompanying msbuild our Azure service fabric packaing has started to fail with the following error:\r\n`\"E:\\One\\Mgmt\\Governance\\Notifications\\src\\Notifications\\Notifications\\Notifications.sfproj\" (Restore target) (1) ->\r\n(Restore target) ->  D:\\msbuild\\17.10.0-dev-24324-01+c6bee852d\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\NuGet\\NuGet.targets(169,5): error : Invalid restore input. Invalid target framework 'unsupported'. Input files: E:\\One\\Mgmt\\Governance\\Notifications\\src\\Notifications\\Notifications\\Notifications.sfproj.`\r\n\r\nI have checked out this repo and binary searched the commits to find where the issue appears. Strangely the first commit to fail is #9722 c6bee85 and the PR before it #9644 a4ecab3 successfully builds. Attached are the two binary logs for successful and failed build with msbuild created from these commits.\r\n[binlog.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15959949/binlog.zip)\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nmsbuild src\\Notifications\\Notifications /t:Package /p:BuildProjectReferences=false /p:Configuration=\"Release\"\r\n\r\nService fabric projects (.sfproj) are .Net 472 and we have package.config file along with project references to csproj which are using central package reference and are .Net 8 runtime.\r\n\r\nHappy to work with MSFT employees to share internal setup.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBuild succeeds and service fabric is properly packaged.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nMsbuild gets to project restore phase and fails to restore for the sfproj file which is packageconfig restoration.\n\n### Analysis\n\nI diffed the detailed logs of the two builds and it appears that this service fabric project switched it's restore project style of PackagesConfig to PackageReference.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

GitHub's linearized repo history puts those commits together but by commit parent order they're pretty far apart, so that commit had more content. Next actions are to try to narrow it down further (maybe with formal `git bisect`). I suspect a NuGet change.",
