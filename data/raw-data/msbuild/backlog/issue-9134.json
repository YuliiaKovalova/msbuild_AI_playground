  "body": "I have a solution (framework version 5.0.0) that contains three projects: a C# console application, a CLR project, and a Static Library project. The \"static library\" project contains c code. I can build and run my application using vs2022 on Windows. However, I couldn't build it on Ubuntu 22. I tried the following commands:\r\n        a- wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh\r\n\tb- sudo chmod +x ./dotnet-install.sh\r\n\tc- ./dotnet-install.sh  --runtime aspnetcore\r\n\t\r\nThen I used the command \"dotnet build\"\r\n\r\nI got the following errors:\r\nMSB4019: The imported project \"/Microsoft.Cpp.targets\" was not found.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I just keep the C# projects and remove the references to the other projects, I can build and run the solution.\r\n\r\nCould you please tell me how I can build my solution with all the projects?",
