On non-Windows, you'll always need a runtime host (either `dotnet` CLI or Mono) to execute MSBuild, and both of those include MSBuild, so there's not much reason for us to go through the packaging effort. In addition, there are all the problems involved with getting the right set of SDKs, tools, targets, and tasks to be able to do something useful with MSBuild--which are solved by the CLI installer.",
