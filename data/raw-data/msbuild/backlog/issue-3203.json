  "title": "Add Project.Sdks property to retrieve SDKs needed to evaluate a project",
  "body": "VS would like to display a list of SDKs (with version) used in a given project.\r\n\r\nThe `Project` class has properties for `Imports` and other things but hasn't been augmented to report Sdks. It should do so, with a signature like\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic IList<SdkReference> Sdks\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn SDK can import another SDK, which could suggest a hierarchical model for this. But the complexity of that is probably too high for the initial implementation of this feature: since Microsoft.NET.Sdk imports common.targets imports Directory.Build.props, any SDK-enabled import in a D.B.props/targets would appear to be referenced from Microsoft.NET.Sdk, which isn't accurate. Any hierarchy would have to account for that.",
