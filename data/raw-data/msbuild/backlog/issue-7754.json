  "body": "See also #2916\r\n\r\nMSBuild.exe has supported `TaskHostFactory` since VS2012, but support only landed in the .NET SDK in version 17.1 (6.0.200).\r\n\r\nIt is possible to write a condition to test for both cases, including making use of a version comparison (assuming that's supported in older VS/SDKs).\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be _far_ more convenient (and far less brittle) to have a property function available to test for this and other features, e.g. `Condition=\" $([MSBuild]::HasFeature('task-host-factory')) \"`. This would then require documenting the feature names for any other new features added in each release.",
