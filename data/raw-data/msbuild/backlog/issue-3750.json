  "title": "How to pack Sdk project's dependencies into generated nuget package?",
  "body": "I have a Sdk project which depends on several nuget projects, and I use below sections to control how the project is packed:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <IsTool>True</IsTool>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <Content Include=\"Sdk\\**\">\r\n      <Pack>True</Pack>\r\n      <PackagePath>Sdk\\</PackagePath>\r\n    </Content>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter packing the nuget package will look like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(root)\r\n    | - Sdk\r\n    |   | - Sdk.targets\r\n    |   | - Sdk.props\r\n    | - tools\r\n        | - ProjectAssembly.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I referenced some tasks from ProjectAssembly.dll in Sdk.targets:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<UsingTask TaskName=\"TaskClassName\" AssemblyFile=\"../tools/ProjectAssembly.dll\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the built assembly needs its dependent assemblies, which was not restored when I use the sdk in project. Is there any way to pack these dependencies into the package, or will msbuild restore them for me in future?",
