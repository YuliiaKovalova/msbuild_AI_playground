  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nIn a scenario not yet fully understood MSBuild will fail to attempt a retry at a copy on these lines:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/54bda1ba66d46f8a11f1710d6d0e7bceac7110ac/src/Tasks/Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets#L4555-L4566\r\n\r\nHere is the redacted output of a build\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"S:\\bamboo\\TSG-TTI1030-CG\\Dotnet\\Source\\Framework\\Interop\\Project\\XXX.Interop.sln\" (Build target) (1:2) ->\r\n        \"S:\\bamboo\\TSG-TTI1030-CG\\Fusion\\Server\\PlatformServices\\CashService\\XXX.CashServiceContracts\\XXX.CashPlatformServiceContracts.csproj\" (default target) (42:7) ->\r\n        (_CopyFilesMarkedCopyLocal target) ->\r\n           C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\amd64\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(4559,5): warning MSB3026: Could not copy \"S:\\bamboo\\TSG-TTI1030-CG\\Bin\\Shared\\XXX.Models.pdb\" to \"..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Bin\\Server\\XXX.Models.pdb\".

But for some reason other places will fail.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is not yet known.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThis should attempt to retry this copy.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThere is never an attempt to recopy.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThe Solution being ran is incredibly complex (~3500 projects in the Solution). The suspicion is that at some point the `$(CopyRetryCount)` is dropped.\r\n\r\nWe are going to attempt setting this as a Window Level Environment Variable (dirty hack) to see if we can survive for now.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\nWindows Server 2019\r\n\r\n`msbuild -version`\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft (R) Build Engine version 16.8.1+bd2ea1e3c for .NET Framework\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
