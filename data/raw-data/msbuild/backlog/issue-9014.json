  "title": "[Bug]: NullReferenceException in BuildManager.OnLoggingThreadException",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nOften after an update of Visual Studio, we get a lot of failed builds with this stack trace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager.OnLoggingThreadException(Exception e)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.RaiseLoggingExceptionEvent(Exception ex)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.LoggingEventProcessor(Object loggingEvent)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.<StartLoggingEventProcessing>g__LoggingEventProc|135_0()\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context(Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart()\r\nAn error occurred when executing task 'Build'.\r\nError: Unexpected end of file while parsing Name has occurred. Line 1, position 45.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor our convenience, we enable binary, file and xml logging during CI builds. Probably the combination of these steps causes the issue. I've deployed a fix to disable both binary and file logger (only keeping xml) and that seems to work. I am now running test builds where both binary and xml are enabled.\r\n\r\nWe use `dotnet msbuild`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHard to repro, it does not happen all the time, but *mostly* after Patch Tuesday when Visual Studio gets updated. Sometimes repairing works, but sometimes it doesn't. Tried restarting the build agents, etc, nothing helped (this time).\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would not expect a NullReferenceException in the BuildManager\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.Execution.BuildManager.OnLoggingThreadException(Exception e)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.RaiseLoggingExceptionEvent(Exception ex)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.LoggingEventProcessor(Object loggingEvent)\r\n   at Microsoft.Build.BackEnd.Logging.LoggingService.<StartLoggingEventProcessing>g__LoggingEventProc|135_0()\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context(Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart()\r\nAn error occurred when executing task 'Build'.\r\nError: Unexpected end of file while parsing Name has occurred. Line 1, position 45.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nCould it be related to having multiple build logging (binary, file and xml) enabled at the same time?\r\n\r\nI did a quick analysis of the code, and technically the work queue could be null here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs#L2773\r\n\r\n`InitializeLoggingService` is called (where event subscription takes place) *before* `_workQueue` gets assigned. (see https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs#L564) \r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nmsbuild --version:\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.6.3+07e294721 for .NET Framework\r\n17.6.3.22601\r\n\r\ndotnet msbuild --version\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.6.8+c70978d4d for .NET\r\n17.6.8.32104",

With dotnet msbuild using the this XML logger, the error below occurred.\r\n```\r\nMSBuild version 17.7.0-preview-23281-03+4ce2ff1f8 for .NET\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB1021: Cannot create an instance of the logger.

The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I tried to reproduce with msbuild using Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022. Here are the detailed steps.\r\n1. Install a lower version of VS.\r\n2. Use Developer Command Prompt to build a ASP.NET Core Web App application. Restore the solution. Then build with multiple loggers `msbuild -bl:LogFromBinaryLogger.binlog -fl -flp:logfile=LogFromFileLogger.log;verbosity=diagnostic -logger:XmlFileLogger,C:\\Users\\<username>\\.nuget\\packages\\msbuild.extension.pack\\1.9.1\\tools\\net40\\MSBuild.ExtensionPack.Loggers.dll;logfile=LogFromXMLLogger.xml;verbosity=Detailed;encoding=UTF-8`.\r\n3.

I tried \"playing\" with the settings, and it *could* be related to the file logger. Once I disabled that one, it started working again (but again: it doesn't happen all the time, but mostly after a VS update).\r\n\r\nI think there is an issue related to the field not being initialized. Maybe instead of having this `NullReferenceException`, you could use something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar workQueue = _workQueue;\r\nif (workQueue is null)\r\n{\r\n    // todo: log extended error or create a valid exception\r\n}\r\n\r\nworkQueue.Post(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least it could provide us with more information in the future that could eventually help solve this issue.\r\n\r\nIt could even be unit tested by manually calling OnThreadException without the queue being initialized (method should be made internal for this).",
