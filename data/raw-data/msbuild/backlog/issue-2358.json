The message is [already `Low`-importance](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/00ff8ba81a8046f87a4476d5f14113e0088c5ca4/src/Build/Evaluation/Evaluator.cs#L1666) and we [log `Low` messages at `Detailed` and higher](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/00ff8ba81a8046f87a4476d5f14113e0088c5ca4/src/Build/Logging/ParallelLogger/ParallelConsoleLogger.cs#L1031-L1032). We probably can\u2019t change the latter so fixing this might involve inventing a new `ReallyLow` level and plumbing it though \u2639",
