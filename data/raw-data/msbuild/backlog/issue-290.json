  "title": "Some tests hang in CoreCLR after failures.",
  "body": "I investigated hangs and found that they occur only when the following conditions are met:\n1. Building **CoreCLR** configuration so that _xunit_ runner is executed using _CoreRun_\n2. A test that required running another copy of _CoreRun_ failed with an exception. Generally, these are tests that invoke MSBuild.exe.\nThen the next test that uses _CoreRun_ and succeeds hangs as that child _CoreRun_ never exists. I even ran the test command from another command window to make sure the second _CoreRun_ is not a child of the first _CoreRun_ and it still hung. For example, the test that hung in my case ran\n`\n\"C:\\lx4\\bin\\Windows_NT\\Debug-NetCore\\CoreRun\" \"C:\\lx4\\bin\\Windows_NT\\Debug-NetCore\\MSBuild.exe\" \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\notepad.exe\" /v:diag\n`\n",
