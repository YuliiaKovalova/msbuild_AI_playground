  "title": "[Bug]: Microsoft.Build 17.5.0: package doesn't include net6.0 target.",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nI have an app that targets .NET 6 and .NET 7 with a reference to the latest `Microsoft.Build` package (`17.5.0`).\r\n\r\nWhen I restore my app, I get the following warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning NU1701: Package 'Microsoft.Build 17.5.0' was restored using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.6.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.1, .NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8, .NETFramework,Version=v4.8.1' instead of the project target framework 'net6.0'.\r\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nA project file:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0;net7.0</TargetFrameworks>\r\n...\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Build\" Version=\"17.5.0\" ExcludeAssets=\"runtime\" />\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo warnings are printed.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nA warning is printed because the net6.0 is not provided by the package.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe warning occurs because `Microsoft.Build` doesn't target `net6.0`, and that causes the app to fall back to `net472` assets for the .NET 6 build.\r\n\r\nIn `17.3.0`, the package was targeting `net6.0`. In `17.4.0`, that target was removed and replaced by `net7.0`.\r\n\r\nBecause .NET 6 is still supported, the package should still provide a `net6.0` target.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "I think the packages are correct, though the end-to-end behavior with the fallback is unfortunate. MSBuild 17.5.0 is usable only in the context of .NET SDK 7.0.200, which requires a .NET 7 runtime, so MSBuild 17.4+ also requires a .NET 7 runtime.\r\n\r\nIf you want a package that references MSBuild assemblies to work on the .NET 6 runtime, you should target a version of MSBuild that supports that, like 17.3.0.\r\n\r\n> Because .NET 6 is still supported, the package should still provide a `net6.0` target.\r\n\r\nWe don't follow this policy because MSBuild is not usable as a standalone library.",
