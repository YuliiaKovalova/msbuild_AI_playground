  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nTarget `GenerateCode` in `Client.csproj` generates `ServiceClient.cs` inside the project.\r\n`ClientTest` references `Client` and calls `ServiceClient.Action()`\r\n\r\nWhen built from the command line, the generated code is not included in the assembly. Interestingly a build in Visual Studio works as expected. (but fails again with `Condition=\"'$(DesignTimeBuild)' != 'true'\"`)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSee complete solution here: https://github.com/devsko/DependentProjectBug\r\n\r\n```\r\nmsbuild DependentProjectBug.sln -t:Clean\r\nmsbuild DependentProjectBug.sln -t:Restore -t:Build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe generated code should be included in the `Client.dll` assembly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe generated code is not included. Calling the generated code results in a build failure.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nI tried various other Before/AfterTarget's without effect.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMSBuild 17.6.0.12203\r\nWindows 11 22H2 22624.1465 x64\r\n",

        "body": "MSBuild is smart enough to know that it can start building multiple projects concurrently. A `ProjectReference` is expected to bring in an assembly that is depended upon. MSBuild will have a given project perform its pre-build steps and then wait for an assembly from another project. But `CodeGenerator` doesn't produce an assembly, `Lib` doesn't actually have code references to `CodeGenerator`, and within the `CodeGenerator` project the `GenerateCode` target runs after the `Build`.\r\n\r\nBecause `CodeGenerator` doesn't produce an assembly and is writing into a different project folder, `CodeGenerator` looks like it is a pre-build step within the `Lib` project; not its own project.",

        "body": "Thanks for your responses.\r\n\r\n@jrdodds I tried to let `CodeGenerator` produce an assembly (as in my real scenario) but the build still failed.\r\n\r\n@rainersigwald That's exactly where I come from. I adapted the repo to even better match the documentation that describes almost exactly my scenario.\r\nWe have a ASP.NET Core web API and use `NSwag aspnet2csclient` to generate the code in `Client`. The only difference is that we use the service assembly as input and not a `.json` definition but I think that makes no difference.\r\n\r\nMaybe I miss something, but I would say the documented example only works in Visual Studio. When built from command line the generated code is not compiled to the assembly. \r\nWhen you add `Condition=\"'$(DesignTimeBuild)' != 'true'\"` to the `GenerateClient` target in `Client.csproj` it even fails in VS with `C:\\repos\\devsko\\DependentProjectBug\\ClientTest\\Program.cs(4,1,4,14): error CS0103: The name 'ServiceClient' does not exist in the current context` .\r\nA second build completes successfully (command line and VS).\r\n\r\nAt the moment we have to run the build step twice during CI to get it succeed. It would be great to find a better solution.",
