  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIn my linux system I have .NET 8 installed here: /home/ihor/.dotnet/ \r\nI have just built the msbuild and I've got this:  /home/ihor/Projects/msbuild/artifacts/bin/bootstrap/net8.0/MSBuild/ \r\nwith contents as in my screenshot below.\r\n\r\nThis is what is said in documentation in ./Building-Testing-and-Debugging-on-.Net-Core-MSBuild.md :\r\n\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, if you want to test the msbuild binaries in a more realistic environment, \r\nyou can overwrite the dotnet CLI msbuild binaries (found under a path like `~/dotnet/sdk/3.0.100-alpha1-009428/`) \r\n\\with the just-built MSBuild . \r\n\r\nYou might have to kill existing `dotnet` processes before doing this. \r\nYou can use [`Deploy-MSBuild.ps1 -runtime Core`](../Deploy-MSBuild.md#.NET-(Core)-SDK) to do the copy. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom this documentation it is totally unclear what should I overwrite and how.\r\n* analog of Deploy-MSBuild.ps1  is missing for Linux.\r\n* In the folder /home/ihor/.dotnet/sdk/8.0.201/   I see many files which match the names with what I've got after building msbuild in my /home/ihor/Projects/msbuild/artifacts/bin/bootstrap/net8.0/MSBuild/   folder, however, there are many of them which differ.\r\n\r\nSo, should I really just take all files and overwrite them? \r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/8807043/fdd667d4-6801-43f6-baef-e8144f670a51)\r\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. build the msbuild on Linux\r\n2. stuck on what to do next: how to put this all to existing .NET 8 installation\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nexpected is a documentation that would state what to do:  is it safe to just overwtire the files?\r\nAlternatively, we need a script similar to Deploy-MSBuild.ps1 but for Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nnot enough information what to do next after I built the msbuild\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
