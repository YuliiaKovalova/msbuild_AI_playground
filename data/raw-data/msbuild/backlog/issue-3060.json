  "body": "FileMatcher has logic to fix some bad pattern matches on Windows.  A recent change in corefx has made it so the same bad pattern matches are returned on non-Windows.  There's a new `EnumerationOptions` class that we can use to bring back the old behavior but it needs to be investigated.\r\n\r\nFor now we're going to manually correct the matches on all platforms.\r\n\r\nCaused by https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27779",
