        "body": "At this point the Mono team doesn't plan on porting the 17.0 changes to their [fork of msbuild](https://github.com/mono/msbuild). Users that require the Mono runtime can explicitly opt in to using that runtime in their SDK-style projects by setting the `UseMonoRuntime` project property to `true`. You can verify that the mono runtime is being used in this scenario by \r\n\r\n* running `dotnet publish -r <your desired runtime identifier> -bl`\r\n* viewing the resulting binlog in the [msbuild structured log viewer](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Providing-Binary-Logs.md),\r\n* looking for uses of the `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.Mono.win-x64` runtime pack.\r\n\r\nYou should see something very much like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/573979/141502601-7a729fcb-67bc-448c-aa21-9b8c55034eea.png)\r\n\r\nand so on demonstrating that the actual implementation assemblies are in fact coming from the Mono build of the runtime.\r\n\r\nThis setup should allow users to stay up to date with the SDK, while also using the runtime that suits them best. Hope this helps!\r\n",

        "body": "My reason was that I depended on msbuild targets that did not run on the dotnet CLI version of MSBuild. It was not about running the compiled output on mono but running MSBuild itself on mono.\r\n\r\nThat has now been resolved and it does not matter anymore. Thanks anyways.",
