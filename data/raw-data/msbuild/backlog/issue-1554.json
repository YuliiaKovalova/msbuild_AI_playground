This makes more sense because after a reload, all the evaluated Project objects depending on the PRE should be dirtied, but the actual PRE should have HasUnsavedChanged=false because it is up to date to the file system.\r\n\r\nThe Reload overload form an XmlReader should leave HasUnsavedChanges=true",
