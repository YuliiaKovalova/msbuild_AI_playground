  "body": "Checking if test projects are up-to-date in already built coreclr repo takes 55% of time of clean repo build. It may indicate that MSBuild overhead for building small projects is higher than actual build cost or that `up-to-date` check is extremely expensive. In normal development situations I would expect it will take small fraction of percent to do that. My experience with large native projects i.e. building Chrome or LLVM/Clang is that I can safely run build command on whole project after making small changes and expect that incremental builds will be fast. In case of managed projects it becomes a kind of `nightmarish`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone coreclr repo on Windows machine\r\n2. Run `build x64 Debug -skiptests` from repo root\r\n3. Run `build-test x64 Debug` from command root and note managed tests build timing (it will be displayed directly after managed tests are built and before wrappers and other components of tests)\r\n4. Run `build-test x64 Debug` again and note managed build timing\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\n\r\nBuild with all tests already built should take small fraction of time i.e. couple of percent at maximum.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nFirst build command run on my laptop takes 16:27.30 while second build which checks only if projects are `up to date` takes `09:04.63` on my laptop.\r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed as well is that memory usage of VBCSCompiler  reaches up to 5 GB, while top level MSBuild node memory usage grows to 1,8 GB and lower level nodes each cross 0,5 GB memory usage level - altogether at the peak build may consume up to 6GB of memory.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\nMSBuild version is determined by BuildTools version used by repo and installed with VS (15.5.180.51428)\r\nWindows 10 Pro x64\r\ncoreclr repo and build tools as of commit 41d23b05acac98c68d3b348c60bf151cfedd778f\r\nVisual Studio 2017 v15.5.2\r\nProcessor Intel Core-i7 4700MQ\r\n16GB RAM\r\n",
