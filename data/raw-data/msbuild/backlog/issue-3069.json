  "title": "MSBuild should define an output group with copy local content",
  "body": "I've noticed in 4 separate occasions folks use BuiltProjectOutputGroupDependencies to mean \"copy local dependencies\" but this is incorrect.  This output group represents dependencies passed to the compiler (`ReferencePath`).  MSBuild doesn't copy these to the output, instead `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths` are copied (as determined by RAR).  I think MSBuild should create a different output group for this.\r\n\r\nThe 4 places I've noticed that got this wrong are:\r\n1. ClickOnce design time /cc @tmeschter \r\n2. [Azure SDK](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-cloud-services-files/blob/master/Azure%20Targets%20SDK%202.9/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.targets#L1793-L1819)\r\n3. Web projects (fixed in vs 15.4)\r\n4. Service Fabric (fixed https://github.com/Azure/service-fabric-issues/issues/54)\r\n\r\nThe one place I noticed that got it right was `CopyLocalFilesOutputGroup` in Microsoft.AppXPackage.targets, but they created their own outputgroup.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice if common.targets could define a single hook for getting this information and we could have everyone use it.\r\n",
