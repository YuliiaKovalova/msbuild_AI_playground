  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nSee #9190 CI builds frequently fail with MSB3021: Access to the path xxx.dll is denied\r\n\r\nI'm using the secret MSBUILDALWAYSRETRY environmental variable to mitigate lots of Copy conflicts that unexpectedly started occurring last month.\r\n\r\nHowever, when this retry happens, a warning is logged without a diagnostic code.\r\nThis means that I cannot exclude this warning in our \"strict\" build that treats warnings as errors:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/971bf70db73ebd5d5e1dde5eb27b8265be9f3169/src/Tasks/Copy.cs#L817\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm currently giving these arguments to MSBuild:\r\n`/WarnAsError /nowarn:\"MSB3270;MSB3026;MSB3021\" /maxcpucount:1`\r\nI'd like to add \"LogDiagnostic\" warnings to the `/nowarn` list, but without a diagnostic code, I cannot see how to do so.\r\n\r\nWe are building to a single directory, so nuget packages that are referenced by multiple projects tend to get written multiple times. But even building single threaded, I cannot seem to avoid conflicts. \r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5167,5): error : Got System.IO.IOException: The process cannot access the file 'F:\\build\\bin\\AnyCPU\\Release\\net472\\libcef.dll' because it is being used by another process.\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5167,5): error :    at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath)\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5167,5): error :    at System.IO.File.InternalCopy(String sourceFileName, String destFileName, Boolean overwrite, Boolean checkHost)\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5167,5): error :    at System.IO.File.Copy(String sourceFileName, String destFileName, Boolean overwrite)\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5167,5): error :    at Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Copy.CopyFileWithLogging(FileState sourceFileState, FileState destinationFileState)\r\nMicrosoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets(5167,5): error :    at Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Copy.DoCopyWithRetries(FileState sourceFileState, FileState destinationFileState, CopyFileWithState copyFile) copying d:\\Nuget\\packages\\cef.redist.x64\\103.0.9\\CEF\\libcef.dll to F:\\build\\bin\\AnyCPU\\Release\\net472\\libcef.dll and HR is -2147024864\r\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nUnable to provide steps to reproduce, as I don't know what changed in our build environment (around the 10th August) that causes so many Copy File conflicts.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIdeally, warnings should include a diagnostic code.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWarning does not currently include a diagnostic code.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",

Or is it possible there has been a change in the build tools?\r\n\r\n#9169 seems to be related to our issue. And the fact that our copy issues started around the time the 7.0.4 sdk was released was an interesting coincidence. \r\nBut according to our build agent logs, our agents didn't actually upgrade until a day or two later, and had suffered lots of failures by then.",

        "body": "@RobSwDev we don't _expect_ a change in MSBuild itself to have caused this--nothing I can think of would have. So I like the \"Windows changed\" theory--but if the platform has changed, we should probably reconsider the \"no point in retrying on `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`\" assumption. As it was, that could speed up an extremely-likely-to-fail build. But if it also now makes likely-to-succeed-on-retry builds fail, that's not necessarily a good tradeoff. So we'd love to root-cause the change, but we're going ahead with #9217 so it's at least suppressible.",
