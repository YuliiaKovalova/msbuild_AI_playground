  "body": "### Issue Description\r\nA regression introduced in `Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.2+857e5a733 for .NET`.\r\nRelated to @ForNeVeR in dotnet/sdk#17976. and @ladipro in #6502\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd a `.well-known\\apple-app-site-association` file to the `wwwroot` folder of an aspnetcore project. Then run `dotnet publish.`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n- The `.well-known\\apple-app-site-association` file should be published to the `wwwroot` folder.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n- The `.well-known\\apple-app-site-association` file is not published to the `wwwroot` folder.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nThis seems to be related to files without an extension like `apple-app-site-association` rendering the `.weel-known` folder to be considered empty and therefore not published.\r\nThis worked previously with `Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.1+2fd48ab73`.\r\n\r\nWorks when the following is added\r\n```csharp\r\n<Content Include=\"wwwroot\\.well-known\\**\" CopyToPublishDirectory=\"Always\" />\r\n```\r\nbut not\r\n```csharp\r\n<Content Include=\"wwwroot\\.well-known\\**\" />\r\n```\r\nNote that none of the above was required in the previous version (`Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.1+2fd48ab73`)\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\non Azure DevOps agent.\r\n- \u2714`Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.1+2fd48ab73 for .NET` publish includes `wwwroot/.well-known` folder\r\n- \u274c`Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.10.2+857e5a733 for .NET` publish **does not** includes `wwwroot/.well-known` folder",
