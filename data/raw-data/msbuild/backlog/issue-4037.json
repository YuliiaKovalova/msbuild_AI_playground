It would be much nicer to be able to write `.*.json` instead. Or just `.*` instead of `.json;.xml;.yml`, in the case that you don't want the project to be picky about what kind of config that it accepts. The same goes for files other than configuration.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be an issue if setting the config file properties to \"copy always\" did the trick, but this only works if the referenced project needs building. If it doesn't need building, then the build for the startup project will just skip it altogether and the config file doesn't get copied into the final output directory.\r\n\r\n",
