  "title": "[Bug]: PackageCertificatePassword argument does not support password protected certificate files",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI have a password protected certificate file (PKCS12) for signing a MAUI (WinUI 3) app as packaged MSIX. So I try to use the `PackageCertificatePassword ` argument to pass the password. This results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\user1\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.windowsappsdk\\1.3.230724000\\buildTransitive\\Microsoft.Build.Msix.Packaging.targets(515,5): \r\nerror APPX0105: Cannot import the key file 'C:\\Temp\\Cert\\example.p12'. The key file may be password protected. \r\nTo correct this, try to import the certificate manually into the current user's personal certificate store.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe MS documentation writes that this is not supported: [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/auto-build-package-uwp-apps)\r\n> Note that a password is only supported for the private key; using a certificate file that is itself password-protected is not currently supported.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nRemoving the password protection from the PKCS12 file enables the file to be used for signing. \r\n\r\n**Security considerations**\r\n- Installing in the personal certificate store (as mentioned in the error) shouldn't be done as the build runs on shared build servers.\r\n- I want to avoid working with unprotected files that contain private keys. The build infrastructure allows to keep those files \"secret\" but I still prefer to keep the password protection in place.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nPackageCertificatePassword should work for a password protected certificate file (PKCS12).\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.8.3+195e7f5a3 for .NET",
