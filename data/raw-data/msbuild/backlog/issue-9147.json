  "body": "### Context\r\n\r\n#8400\r\nPrototype was created: https://github.com/JanKrivanek/MSBuildBinlogRedactor (it currently needs a private MSBuild nuget - as the exposed MSBuild api is not yet merged)\r\nThe prototype properly replies the binary events - it however doesn't care about the embadded files.\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n\r\nAll supplemental content of the original binlog (embedded files, anything else?) is copied over to target binlog file aftery replying.\r\nThis should eas well work when post-processing (replying) binlog that was produced on a different machine.\r\nNice to have - the embadded files are as well processed as text data and scanned for sensitive data occurence.",
