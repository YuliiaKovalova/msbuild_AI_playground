  "title": "Reduce code clones for parsing the SolutionConfiguration xml",
  "body": "There's multiple code clones that either parse or emit the xml for the `CurrentSolutionConfigurationContents` xml (see details https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/6738) that VS sets as a global property: \r\n- Microsoft.Build.Tasks.ResolveProjectBase.CacheProjectElementsFromXml\r\n- Microsoft.Build.Construction.SolutionProjectGenerator.AddPropertyGroupForSolutionConfiguration\r\n- Microsoft.Build.Experimental.ProjectCache.ProjectCacheService.PostCacheRequest.GenerateGraphEntryPointsFromSolutionConfigurationXml\r\n\r\nTo increase maintainability and reuse it would be nice to create an object model for this structure which can serialize / deserialize itself to / from the xml.\r\n\r\n1st option: Add new classes. Unfortunately there will be a bit of an overlap between these and the existing Microsoft.Build.Construction.SolutionFile, Microsoft.Build.BuildEngine.Shared.ProjectInSolution, and Microsoft.Build.BuildEngine.Shared.ProjectConfigurationInSolution\r\n\r\n2nd option: Massage the existing SolutionFile, ProjectInSolution, and ProjectConfigurationInSolution to accomodate `CurrentSolutionConfigurationContents` as well. Unfortunately these types are already a bit messy so messing them up even further might be too much.\r\n\r\nRegardless of which option we choose, we'll have to put the OM in shared sources because both the tasks dll and the engine dll need to depend on it.\r\n\r\nGiven these complexities and the fact that the project cache VS workaround should be deleted at some point, maybe it's not worth doing any of this. Or maybe it's worth doing a rewrite / redesign of the whole solution object model and metaproject generation logic. That area of the code is a bit of a quagmire",
