        "body": "Back again, \r\n\r\nSeems there was a basic rule about MSBuild targets that I didn't know when I started it recently,\r\nand that was the fact that the targets would run on the target assembly and not the assembly included the targets file unless you import it manually. That led me wrong. (Know the procedure now) \r\nBut I think one other issue also was happening in every project, some times it seems those target files even wouldn't run on the targets project randomly and they start working after quit/reopen, clearing bin/obj thing, and such other tricks. (though they were included in the csproj files and they were nuget packages)\r\nBy the way seems I am currently on the path, and my projects and the MSBuild files are working as expected, built several successful projects finally.\r\n\r\nthank you for following the topic,\r\nIf possible I have 2 other questions,\r\nwhich can ask and mention you in a different topic\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nKasra",
