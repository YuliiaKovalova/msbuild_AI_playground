  "title": "Fix localization setup for release branches",
  "body": "### Background\r\nMSBuild is at times getting flood of self negating commits in OneLocBuild PRs. \r\n\r\n### Rootcause\r\nThis is apparently caused by main and some release branches sharing the same localization `PackageId` and even branch - e.g. `vs17.2` specifies the condition for self, but `mirrorBranch` as `main`: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/vs17.2/.vsts-dotnet.yml#L45-L51\r\n\r\n### What needs to be done\r\nOfficial info: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/OneLocBuild.md#if-youre-releasing-from-a-branch-other-than-main-including-servicing-branches\r\n_Option 1_ - use the localization only in `main`, and temporarily flip it on release only if some localization string was changed there\r\n_Option 2_:\r\n * create ticket with localization team to ask for second project for release branches (or main)\r\n * update the pipline code to properly condition based on branch name and specify correct branch and appropriate localization id\r\n\r\nI'd strongly recomend _agains Option 1_ - as it's prone to easily missed overlooks and forgeting (it's likely what got us in current situation).\r\n\r\n### Related information\r\n * [Sample MSBuild OneLoc PR with multitude of self-negatig commits](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/8775)\r\n * [Internal link] [IcM ticket inquiring about the multi comits of localization job](https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/details/393679625/home)\r\n * [Templating localization setup](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/blob/main/azure-pipelines.yml#L45-L63)",
