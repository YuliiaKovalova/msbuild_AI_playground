  "title": "[Performance]: Loading SDK resolvers is slow on Windows",
  "body": "A recent experiment has shown that resolving in-box SDKs (e.g. `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`) directly in MSBuild without loading any of the configured resolvers has a significant perf impact.\r\n\r\nPerfStar shows a ~5% improvement in build time, but strangely enough, only on Windows. The Linux numbers are unaffected.\r\n\r\nExperimental change: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/main...perf/sdk-resolution-shortcut3\r\n\r\nPerfStar results:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/12206368/0bfa9988-ec63-4ac8-b1d2-7ad541a844c1)\r\n\r\n## Expected output\r\n\r\n- Understand why this change affects only Windows. Is it the OS/runtime or is MSBuild/SDK doing something expensive?\r\n- Find opportunities to make SDK resolution on Windows faster even in cases where we need to load resolvers.\r\n- [non-goal] Productizing the experiment will be done as part of #9506, it is not a goal of this issue.

        "body": "_Too good to be true_ is the unfortunate outcome of this investigation. The baseline runs used by PerfStar for the **Avg 30 days** column all took place before December 5th 2023 and there is a significant difference between those results and what we're getting from recent experimental runs. The dashboard is not showing any main/baseline runs after 12/5. So this is not an apples-to-apples comparison.\r\n\r\nThe actual perf win, as calculated from two experimental runs, one with the changes and one without, is ~0.5%. This is more in line with expectations because what this essentially does is eliminate one or two assembly loads + some JITting from the evaluation code path.\r\n\r\n@AR-May can you please check why PerfStar is not running on main and why the December runs were so different? For what it's worth, I see no difference when I manually compare a main build from 12/5 with current main.\r\n\r\ncc @Forgind as I see that you recently submitted an experimental run. Please note that the relative results are invalid. Absolute numbers can still be compared with other experimental runs.",
