  "body": "### Context\nThis recently came up internally when a customer tried to move from `.sln` to .`slnx`. Not all targets were included. The fix was to rename the existing `after.{SolutionName}.sln.targets` to `after.{SolutionName}.slnx.targets`.\n\n### Suggestion\nFor the smoother transition experience from `.sln` to the new solution format `.slnx` we should load `after.{SolutionName}.sln.targets` for `.slnx` too. We decided not to load `after.{SolutionName}.slnx.targets` for `.slnx`.\n",
