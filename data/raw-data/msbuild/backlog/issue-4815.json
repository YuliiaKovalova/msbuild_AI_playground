  "body": "Hi,\r\nplease help localization team to answer question from translator.\r\nIn case translator is not sure about context/meaning/localizability of string we raise a question.\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nMSB4019: The imported project \"{0}\" was not found. Confirm that the expression in the Import declaration \"{1}\" is correct, and that the file exists on disk.\r\n\r\nFile Name:\r\nBuild\\Resources\\xlf\\Strings.xlf\r\n\r\n==========================================\r\nQuery:\r\nAccording to the DevComment, `<Import>` should not be localized.\r\nDoes it refer to \"Import\" of \"the Import declaration\" in this source?\r\nCould you please confirm?",
