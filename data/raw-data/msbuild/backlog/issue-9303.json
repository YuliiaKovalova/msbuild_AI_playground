  "title": "[Performance]: MSBuild.exe spends 300 ms JITting Microsoft.DotNet.MSBuildSdkResolver.dll",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWe currently load SDK resolvers using `Assembly.LoadFrom` on .NET Framework, which disqualifies it from using native images even if they existed. We should:\r\n- Figure out a way to use regular `Assembly.Load`, e.g. load into a separate appdomain with a generated app config.\r\n- Make sure the .NET SDK resolver and the NuGet SDK resolver assemblies are added to the NGEN queue by Visual Studio installer and produce usable images.\r\n\r\nThe potential perf gain is about 300 ms of JITting saved, out of 1100 ms total for a simple app build using MSBuild.exe. It should also lay some groundwork for eliminating another big chunk of JITting: `Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.dll`.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nCollect JIT stats of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> MSBuild.exe SimpleProject.csproj\r\n```\n\n### Data\n\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/12206368/a69a4537-346c-4b67-87ba-f284d6265f38)\r\n\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_\n\n### Regression\n\n- [ ] yes\n- [ ] no\n\n### Regression Details\n\n_No response_",
