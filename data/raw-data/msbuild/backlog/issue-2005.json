What I can see from the code you posted `if (cpuCount == 1 && ...)`, it checks if `cpuCount` is one. This should be the case, as the build server is a single core VM and the cpuCount should be 1 no matter how many cores you specify.\r\n\r\nMaybe the code should also check whether the the system does in fact have more then one CPU to actually benefit from `/m`",
