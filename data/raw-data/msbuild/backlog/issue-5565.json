This means that with cross-targeting, MSBuild can be confused when building the exact same project, lock the dll as it writes, and fail.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nI think this will work, although I haven't actually tested it, since I don't want to download C++ \ud83d\ude04 :\r\nCreate a .vcxproj as normal\r\nSpecify TargetFrameworks=\"net462\"\r\nBuild\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nIt builds for net462 alone.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nCL : fatal error C1083: Cannot open compiler intermediate file: ...\r\nPermission denied",
