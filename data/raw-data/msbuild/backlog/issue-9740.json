  "title": "[Feature Request]: Terminal Logger primary outputs should optionally use absolute paths",
  "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/38552 @tmds requested that the primary outputs of built projects be able to emit the absolute path instead of relative paths. While we don't think this should be the _default_ behavior, some kind of knob here does make sense for their use case.\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nWe chose relative paths for the output (with clickable/right-click-able directory urls) for readability and usability based on customer feedback from the first Terminal Logger releases. However some user workflows benefit from copying the direct file. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nWe should enable this either by emitting the absolute path visually, or by making the generated `file://`-scheme URIs (for terminals that support clickable links) emit absolute paths. This should be toggled via some option, it should not be the default.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n_No response_",
