  "body": "I would like to compile a VS 2017 solution with msbuild via C# and the MSbuild SDK. However, I am unable to turn a solution into a project by the SolutionWrapperProject.Generate method with a toolsversion 15.0. Not specifying the toolsversion generates a 4.0 project, specifying 15.0 yields an error message. I am using the latest version of the SDK, which has been installed via nuget.",

That is required to get projects to build.",
