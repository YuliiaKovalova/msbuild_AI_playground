  "title": "Warning for properties defined in project but never read",
  "body": "Since MSBuild allows defining any property, it's very common to define the wrong property accidentally--either via typo, or by guessing a wrong name. When this happens, it's rarely clear what has gone wrong.\r\n\r\nIf there was a warning that fired when a project defined a property that was never read, that could help. Ideally it would also do some sort of edit-distance based \"did you mean X, Y, or Z?\" like many command line applications do.\r\n\r\nThis probably should apply only to the project file itself. It's reasonable for `Directory.Build.props` and friends to define properties for all projects that are consumed by only some of them.\r\n\r\nEvidently cmake has this: https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1134108018738524167",

E.g. properties that affect pack are unused when doing a build.\r\n\r\nThat's a big problem. It _might_ be ok to ignore it, but probably not.",
