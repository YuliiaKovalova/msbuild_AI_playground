  "title": "XamlDataDrivenToolTask does not take into account UseCommandProcessor when determining whether to use response files on Windows",
  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate an XamlTaskFactory definition which uses CommandLineTemplate and will result in a command line over over 8191 characters in length.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWhen UseCommandProcessor is set to true, the threshold for whether to use response files will be lowered from 32k to 8k.\r\n\r\nLooking closer at XamlTaskFactory, there's no way to determine what the real executable is without guessing, so without major changes the best thing would be for a very clear error message to be logged.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe 30k limit is still used so command lines over 8k will still attempt to be passed through to cmd. This causes unexpected behaviour - in my case it caused a random letter to be truncated at the 8191 mark.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is counter to the comment which says we can ignore the 8K limit as cmd.exe is not used - but it is.\r\n```cs\r\n// If the command is too long, it will most likely fail. The command line\r\n// arguments passed into any process cannot exceed 32768 characters, but\r\n// depending on the structure of the command (e.g. if it contains embedded\r\n// environment variables that will be expanded), longer commands might work,\r\n// or shorter commands might fail -- to play it safe, we warn at 32000.\r\n// NOTE: cmd.exe has a buffer limit of 8K, but we're not using cmd.exe here,\r\n// so we can go past 8K easily.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is caused in a combination of these three lines:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/6f41a4fa3c6957d430783b7d31fe16e6a13b6e8e/src/Tasks/XamlTaskFactory/XamlDataDrivenToolTask.cs#L466\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/6f41a4fa3c6957d430783b7d31fe16e6a13b6e8e/src/Tasks/XamlTaskFactory/XamlDataDrivenToolTask.cs#L149\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/6f41a4fa3c6957d430783b7d31fe16e6a13b6e8e/src/Utilities/ToolTask.cs#L1342\r\n\r\nRelated links:\r\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/830473/command-prompt-cmd-exe-command-line-string-limitation",
