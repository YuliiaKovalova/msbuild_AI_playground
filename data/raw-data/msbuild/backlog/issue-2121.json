  "body": "If some combination of the MSBuild command line and response file list multiple projects, MSBuild emits an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMSBUILD : error MSB1008: Only one project can be specified.\r\nSwitch: .\\msbuild.binlog\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that error only lists one project. It would be nice if it listed all of the projects, to make it easier to figure out what intent was.\r\n\r\nIssues like #2112 would be more easily debugged if this was the case.",
