  "body": "\r\n[BCTest_Repro.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16390266/BCTest_Repro.zip) has a solution with library projects, custom props and targets file in TestImport folder, as well as .editorconfig. Binary log is also included in the zip file. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce, execute the steps below:\r\n1.  Set environment variable `set Test=true`\r\n2.  Build with analyzers: `dotnet <msbuild repo root>\\artifacts\\bin\\bootstrap\\net8.0\\MSBuild\\MSBuild.dll BCTest_Repro.sln -analyze -restore -bl`.\r\n3.  Custom props file which is imported by ClassLibrary2.csproj accepting the environment variable `Test`. Because of  `build_check.BC0103.scope=project` configured in .editorconfig, BC0103 should not be triggered. Actual result is it's triggered and even applied to SDK imports.\r\n4. Custom targets file copies a file to the solution folder. It's imported by ClassLibrary2.csproj and ClassLibrary3.csproj both. Because of  `build_check.BC0102.scope=project` configured in .editorconfig, BC0102 should not be triggered. Actual result is it's triggered for the imported target.\r\nIt looks like BuildCheck doesn't respect [EvaluationAnalysisScope documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/BuildCheck/BuildCheck.md#scope-of-analysis).",
