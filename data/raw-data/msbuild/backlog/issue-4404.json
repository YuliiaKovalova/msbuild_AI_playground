  "body": "MSBuild is not a perfect Build Tool ...\r\nUnfortunately it is not easy to create custom target and extend Build Tool with plugin ...\r\n\r\nDo you consider a switch at least to other Build System ?\r\n\r\nOn other hand there is exist Gradle. It is very extensible Build System and very easily extended with custom plugin.\r\nThere is an open issue https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1428 which is relates to support of C# and .sln\r\n\r\nI know there are people which is annoying that Gradle is written on JVM, but at the end of the day it s just a technology, and does not matter on which language it is built in ... Matter only quality of the technology ...\r\n\r\nDo you consider possibility to switch or at least add plugin support to Gradle for C# language ?\r\n\r\nP.S.: This question is also asked on DotNet https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/24789",
