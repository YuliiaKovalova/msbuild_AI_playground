  "title": "[Broken Build]: apphost.exe is missing from the runtime obj folder",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nMSBuild version 17.3.2+561848881 for .NET\r\n**dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.407\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets(277,5): error MSB3030:\r\n Could not copy the file obj\\x64\\Release\\net6.0\\win-x64\\apphost.exe because it was not found.**\r\n \r\n The build fails because apphost.exe isn't present in the win-x64 folder. There's a singlefilehost.exe file in there, but the apphost.exe file is only present in the parent directory `obj\\x64\\Release\\net6.0\\`.\r\n \r\n I can work-around this issue by manually copying the apphost.exe from `obj\\x64\\Release\\net6.0\\` into ``obj\\x64\\Release\\net6.0\\win-x64\\` and re-running the build. Though perhaps it would be better suited to create a symbolic link.\r\n \r\n \r\n Project configuration:\r\n \r\n ```\r\n   <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <ApplicationIcon />\r\n    <OutputType>exe</OutputType>\r\n    <GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles>true</GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles>\r\n    <StartupObject />\r\n    <Prefer32Bit>false</Prefer32Bit>\r\n    <PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <TargetLatestRuntimePatch>true</TargetLatestRuntimePatch>\r\n    <Configurations>Debug;Release</Configurations>\r\n    <Platforms>x64</Platforms>\r\n    <RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  Build command:\r\n  \r\n  `msbuild MySolution.sln /t:Clean;Restore;Publish /p:PublishSingleFile=True /p:SelfContained=True /p:Configuration=release /p:Platform=x64 /p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64`\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nDelete the bin and obj directories and try publishing using msbuild. \r\n\r\nNote: `dotnet publish` is not an option because this solution has .NET 6 and .NET Framework 4.8 projects.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nBuild completes.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nBuild fails because it didn't place the apphost.exe file where it needs it.\n\n### Ask us questions\n\nThis build was previously working fine with a combination of msbuild and dotnet publish commands in .NET 5.0 and earlier. \r\n\r\nI started getting staticwebassets.build.json is missing, and a runtime json which I fixed using `<GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles>true</GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles>` .",
