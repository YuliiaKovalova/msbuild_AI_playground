However at that step we only have access to a list of targets to be built, but not which ones are the initial targets or the entry points for the build.\r\nThe list of targets to build passed is a mix of initial targets, and the rest of the targets all joined together https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/cd64b7b4a690d809cf14fe2af807a328cce04e54/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/BuildRequestConfiguration.cs#L758\r\n\r\nTo make the change requested here we would have to partially rewrite how targets are ordered to build, or do some pretty hacky stuff on the code and change all the tests to match, and we do not have the capacity for such a big change at the moment. Moving this to backlog for now.",
