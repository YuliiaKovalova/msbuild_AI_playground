  "title": "Passing AssemblyName as argument of MSBuild propagates it to referenced projects.",
  "body": "**Version Used**: \n.NET SDK 9.0.203\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n1. Create a .NET Class Library. Name it P1.\n2. Create a second .NET Class Library. Name it P2.\n3. Add project reference in P2 to P1.\n4. Build P2 from command-line using msbuild.exe with the following command:\n````\nmsbuild.exe P2.csproj /p:AssemblyName=\"P3\"\n````\n\nA minimal repro, with source-code provided, is ideal.  Most compiler/language issues can be distilled into a snippet that can be pasted into [sharplab](https://sharplab.io/).\n\n**Diagnostic Id**:\nn/a\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n- Have P3.dll in P2's /bin folder.\n- Have P1.dll in P1's /bin folder, because the argument 'AssemblyName' is not supposed to be propagated.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n- Have P3.dll in P2's /bin folder.\n- Have P3.dll in P1's /bin folder.\n- Both dlls contain their respective codebase.\n\nWhen inspecting the P3.dll in P2 project folder, a circular reference is observed:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49bc22e7-28c1-458b-9495-223bc3a20076)\n\nThe issue is reproducible with .NET and .NET Framework SDK-style project files.\nI've attached 2 .zips, demonstrating the issue in .NET 8 and .NET Framework 4.6.2.\n[ProjRef_net462.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20091559/ProjRef_net462.zip)\n[ProjRef_net8.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20091560/ProjRef_net8.zip)\n",
