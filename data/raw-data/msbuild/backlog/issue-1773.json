  "body": "An SDK may wish to \"quirk\" its behavior in a new version to match old behavior. To do so, it will need to know when the requested version is lower than the current version.\r\n\r\nMSBuild could inject a property into the evaluated project based on the version of the Sdk from the project file, which could be used by the imported logic to change behavior.\r\n\r\nThe property would need to be specific to the Sdk's name, which might require some thought, since naming conventions and property name conventions don't necessarily match.",
