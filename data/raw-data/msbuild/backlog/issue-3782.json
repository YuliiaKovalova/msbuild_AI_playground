  "body": "I see some machines use a localized Visual Studio and MSBuild (e.g. Russian or German). There needs to be a way (command-line switch? property? environment variable?) to force the log messages to English. When investigating (e.g. binlogs) we should be able to ask the customers to produce an English log (esp. that localized logs are pretty useless for diagnostics as you can't search for the messages).",
