As pointed out [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57479355/how-to-mark-files-of-a-folder-as-embedded-resource-with-wildcards-with-the-new-p/57482357#57479355) i was trying to get a wildcard applied to treat a certain folder as embedded resources. While Lance successfully resolved my build issue, there was a display error in VS which would not indicate that this is treated as an embedded resource. \r\n\r\nMy guess is that the reason is that VS expects a Compile Remove=\"path\" on top of the generated EmbeddedResource?\r\n\r\n### Expected  behavior\r\nI would expect VS to report EmbeddedResource here. Perhaps it's the case that in its current state it is both embedded + compiled?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nIt tells me the files in the TestContent folder are just being compiled.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5545184/62963129-afc96680-be00-11e9-8171-df59b5a9b405.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOS info:\r\nWindows 8.1\r\nVisual Studio 2019 executing MSBuild\r\n",

That should apply a project change like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/4610.csproj b/4610.csproj\r\nindex 50de00b..7916704 100644\r\n--- a/4610.csproj\r\n+++ b/4610.csproj\r\n@@ -5,4 +5,12 @@\r\n     <RootNamespace>_4610</RootNamespace>\r\n   </PropertyGroup>\r\n \r\n+  <ItemGroup>\r\n+    <Compile Remove=\"Class1.cs\" />\r\n+  </ItemGroup>\r\n+\r\n+  <ItemGroup>\r\n+    <EmbeddedResource Include=\"Class1.cs\" />\r\n+  </ItemGroup>\r\n+\r\n </Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(you can also apply a change like this manually).\r\n\r\nThat will apply at evaluation time, so Visual Studio will see and understand the issue.",
