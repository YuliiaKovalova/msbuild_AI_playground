I tried building five times, pulling in latest changes, and clearing all artifacts. The build displays and gets stuck at `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime ->` which is in the packing stage. It went up to one hour for one of the executions, before I killed it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n0. Ensure that `DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` is set to `1`.\r\n1. `.\\build.cmd -allconfigurations`\r\n\r\nUnable to attach binlog when building with `-bl` since the build was cancelled early.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nBuild is successful.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nBuild is stuck on `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime ->`.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nSteps taken to debug:\r\n1. Attached a debugger to the host process, which seemed to just be stuck in `System.Threading` code.\r\n2. Process tree just shows a bunch of MSBuild.dll invocations:\r\n![process-tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12636891/206589980-bfc51be4-e81a-4932-95a8-0577348aba56.png)\r\n3. Using `procexp`, I couldn't pinpoint a handle that referenced `Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime`.\r\n4. @hoyosjs suggested rebuilding with `DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` set to `0`, and the build was successful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's some deadlock in the msbuild server?\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n- On Windows 11 x86_64\r\n- `dotnet msbuild --version` prints\r\n```\r\nMSBuild version 17.4.0+18d5aef85 for .NET\r\n17.4.0.51802\r\n```\r\n- `dotnet --version` prints `7.0.100`\r\n\r\n/cc @rokonec \r\n",
