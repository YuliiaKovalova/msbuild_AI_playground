  "body": "[Mirrored from an internal bug]\n\nWe\u2019re getting the following error when trying to use MSBuild\u2019s SignFile task: An error occurred while signing: Issuer node is required. This is happening in the MSBuild that is being shipped with VS in project Willow, which is how I first ran into the issue.  I tried debugging it last week with MSBuild\u2019s master and I managed to reproduce it simply by running the SignFile task by itself (proj and manifest files attached). The repro steps would be:\n\n\u2022Place both files in the same directory\n\u2022Replace the thumbprint with one from a local certificate\n\u25e6I created a test certificate from within VS by going into any project Properties \u00e0 Signing \u00e0 Create Test Certificate (figure attached)\n\u25e6From there I got the thumbprint from More Details\n\u2022Run msbuild on test.proj\n\n``` XML\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\" DefaultTargets=\"Build\">\n<Target Name=\"Build\">\n<SignFile\nCertificateThumbprint=\"2197530A7E887D6E86CB25D7B42D4D8AA2EF1D5F\"\nSigningTarget=\"$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\\ExcelAddIn2.dll.manifest\"\nTargetFrameworkVersion=\"v4.5.2\"\n/>\n</Target>\n</Project>\n```\n\nI was debugging MSBuild and the exception was being thrown by this line: mansign2.cs:1425. The call stack points to XmlLicenseTransform.LoadInput and for .NET 4.6.1 it looks like it was coming from this line: transform.cs:1421. If I understand correctly, it seems like the license MSBuild is generating (SignedCmiManifest.CreateLicenseDom) has a different format from expected (at least for that transform). Not sure if it helps, but I also have a dump file.\n",
