  "title": "[Bug]: Help message does not contain some switches (-getProperty, -getTargetResult)",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nSome of the supported command line switches are not mentioned in the help message. For example `-getProperty` and `-getTargetResult` but there may be more.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n`msbuild -h`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nContains help for `-getProperty`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDoes not contain help for `-getProperty`.\n\n### Analysis\n\nAll switches should be cross-checked against the help message strings to see what else is missing. It may also be useful to introduce a lightweight mechanism for keeping help up-to-date, for example by having to list the relevant string resource ID in `s_parameterlessSwitchesMap` / `s_parameterizedSwitchesMap`.\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\n_No response_",
