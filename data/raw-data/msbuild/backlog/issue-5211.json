        "body": "This is mostly fixed, but I want to repurpose this issue to see if I can get rid of having a StringBuilder in the first place. If we just pass the parameters and items with metadata directly to the loggers (on the TaskStartedEventArgs presumably), then the loggers will not need to allocate the strings altogether, they'll write into their streams directly. \r\n\r\nWe can have the method that produces these strings on the Args in case the logger still wants the strings.\r\n\r\nWe'll need to think how to make this change backwards compatible, such that the loggers that are unaware of this change still get the exact same behavior as before.\r\n\r\nBut certainly I'd like to optimize this throughput for binary logger to minimize the allocation overhead.",
