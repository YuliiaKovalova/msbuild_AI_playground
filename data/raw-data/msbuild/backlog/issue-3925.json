  "title": "Intermittent problem, nugetorgadd.trk being used by another process",
  "body": "Currently trying to troubleshoot an issue which is intermittently happening on our continuous integration server.  I can't consistently repro, but our build fails with the following error:\r\n`error : C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\2.1.401\\Sdks\\MSBuild.Sdk.Extras\\Sdk not found. Check that a recent enough .NET Core SDK is installed and/or increase the version specified in global.json.`\r\nshortly after this warning:\r\n`The SDK resolver \"NuGetSdkResolver\" failed to run. The process cannot access the file 'C:\\Users\\cloud-user\\AppData\\Roaming\\NuGet\\nugetorgadd.trk' because it is being used by another process.`\r\n\r\nDiscovered where in the nuget code for this lives, also posted on NuGet github forum:\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7503\r\n\r\nWas wondering if anyone here might have any ideas, though (e.g., is it possible this code is being executed simultaneously on two different MSBuild threads, why would that happen?).  I can run this build using MSBuild in a debugger and set breakpoints if it would help, but I can't repro the above problem this way.\r\n\r\nThanks so much",

MSBuild has code to run resolvers only once in a build, so I suspect the problem is sharing that file between builds, or something maintaining a long-lived lock on the file. If NuGet's investigation shows that they're not at fault we can reopen this.",
