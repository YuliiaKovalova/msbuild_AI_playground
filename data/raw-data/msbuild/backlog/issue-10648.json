  "body": "Inspired by this [comment](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/10320#issuecomment-2340988345). It looks like we are not using `ObjectDisposedException` when we should. This exception indicates exactly why the operation couldn't be completed and reduces confusion. We should throw this exception at least in public disposable types.",
