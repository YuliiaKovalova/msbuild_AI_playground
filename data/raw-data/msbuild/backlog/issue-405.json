  "body": "After updating to Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 (MSBuild 14.0.24720.0) batches containing piped find commands do not work anymore.\n\nThe following batch command searches for 'b' in 'abc' and finds a match. The errorlevel is set to 0 by the find command.\n\n``` Batchfile\necho abc | find \"b\"\n```\n\nWhen executing a batch file containing the above command from MSBuild, then no match is detected. This worked before with MSBuild 14.0.23107.0.\n\nBut when using findstr instead of find there is no issue with  MSBuild 14.0.24720.0.\n\n``` Batchfile\necho abc | findstr /L \"b\"\n```\n\nsee https://gist.github.com/bluerobotch/5d160080dba4400e2c6b for a full example.\n",

Your workaround is a good one.\n\nAs with the others, you should also be able to work around the problem by running\n\n``` cmd\nchcp 437\n```\n\nat the beginning of the Exec's `Command` or in the batch file that you're calling.  I confirmed that `find.exe` does use the current console codepage to determine what string conversions to apply--though I'm still confused about exactly what's going wrong in this case.\n",

Its a good thing to know that MSBuild now executes commands using the utf-8 code page when running on hosts with >= win7. \nAs i understand it's more a problem with `find.exe` than with MSBuild. Therefore we will keep our workaround.\n\nConcerning Update 1, thanks pointing that out.\n",
