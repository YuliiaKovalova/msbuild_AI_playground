  "body": "I need a task that:\r\n\r\n* Runs after the project build\r\n* Only runs once, even on multi-framework projects\r\n* Is brought in by a NuGet package\r\n\r\nThe following works in the .csproj, or a .targets file directly imported by the .csproj. But it does not run in a .targets file brought in by a NuGet package.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Target Name=\"RunMyScript\" AfterTargets=\"Build\" Condition=\" '$(IsCrossTargetingBuild)' == 'true' \">\r\n    <Message Text=\"===== RunMyScript has been called! =====\" Importance=\"High\" />\r\n</Target>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a stripped down version of my project:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop\">\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n        <OutputType>Library</OutputType>\r\n        <TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp3.0;net462;net48</TargetFrameworks>\r\n        <UseWPF>true</UseWPF>\r\n        <Version>8.6.9</Version>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n        <PackageReference Include=\"MyNuGetPackage\" Version=\"2.2.2\">\r\n            <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>\r\n            <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>\r\n        </PackageReference>\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way?",

        "body": "@dasMulli I tried your [suggestion](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/issues/2540#issuecomment-555381626) (thanks!) and made my nuget package put my targets file in `Sdk\\Sdk.targets` (I don't have a props file). But the target doesn't run, even without conditions. The .csproj looks the same as before. The [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5002999&view=vs-2019) don't look like what I'm doing, to my eye. Any ideas? \ud83e\udd14 ",
