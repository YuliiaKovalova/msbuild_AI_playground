  "body": "Hi. \r\n\r\nI faced with an issue that I cannot find info about how to integrate my `.targets` file from .Net Framework to a new .Net Core project file.\r\n\r\nCan someone point me in the right direction please?\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\nCurrently I am struggling with my `.targets` file trying to make it work, but in one case it just dont run at all, in other - there is compilation error saying:\r\n`task could not be loaded from the assembly...`\r\n`Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.2.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. Confirm that the <UsingTask> declaration is correct, that the assembly and all its dependencies are available, and that the task contains a public class that implements Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask.`\r\n\r\nWhich is I think related to some inconsistency between .Net Core and .Net standard (which uses MSBuild.Uitilities nuget package\r\n",

MSBuild for some reason in trying to start wrong environment (seems .Net framework instead of .Net Core) In Rider there is an option to select MSBuild version and it working quite well, but in such configuration it fails to run under VS 2019.\r\nIs there any way to make it work or I need to switch using Exec task instead?\r\n\r\nI cannot use `netstandard2.0` in my projects, so this variant is inappropriate for me.",

        "body": "@rainersigwald I already found out that this happenes because MSBUILD cold not run .NetCore 3.0 or higher tasks, but only netstandrad2.0 or lower, which war very strange and unexpected to me.\r\nFor ex., Rider is building and running such task without issues, because it uses MSBUILD for .Net core instead of some custom, which Visual Studio is using.\r\n\r\nAnd my question is:\r\nDo you plan to ship fix for this anytime soon? Maybe at least for .Net 5 release?",
