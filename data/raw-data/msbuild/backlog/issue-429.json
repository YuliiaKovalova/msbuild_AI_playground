        "body": "This is because of dotnet/corefx/issues/1745--`System.Uri` doesn't understand absolute Unix paths. We use `Uri.MakeRelativeUri` as the implementation of `MakeRelative` (which seems to be the \u201cstandard\u201d way of getting a relative path in .NET), and it throws when we try to construct an absolute `Uri` out of a rooted Unix path.\n\nUnfortunately, the logic of constructing relative paths is complicated; reimplementing it here is likely to be error prone (and/or behave in a subtly different way than other implementations). Ideally something like https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/2836 would be available to us.\n",
