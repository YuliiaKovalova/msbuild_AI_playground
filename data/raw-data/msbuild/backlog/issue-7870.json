  "title": "\"Broken pipe\" errors from tasks calling Process.Start() in latest 17.4.0-preview MSBuild",
  "body": "\r\n### Issue Description\r\nAs part of investigating https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/10311, I realized that there seems to be some kind of change in MSBuild, where build tasks that call Process.Start fail due to non-zero exit code.  Digging in, all the errors were from scripts being run getting \"broken pipe\" type errors on Linux.  I swapped out the entire \"bad\" .NET Core runtime used into the \"good\" SDK and did not get a repro; this leads me to believe (along with the only repro beign in a build task) that this is an MSBuild bug.  I've leveraged a custom version of the .NET Arcade task that hit the original issue as a repro.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n(Assuming the files from repro.zip are copied to c:\\scratch\\hosting-bug-repro)\r\n\r\nTo see the expected behavior:\r\nHappy SDK 7.0.100-rc.1.22377.7 does not repro the problem (Version 7.0.22.36704 @Commit: aafa91036e1efd3d4dcb67eeb261cb6d8f774685)\r\nHappy SDK has MSBuild version 17.4.0-preview-22366-04+d2871ca13\r\n\r\n1) docker run -v c:/scratch/hosting-bug-repro:/repro -it mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:ubuntu-18.04-20220808192747-20889cf\r\n2) cd /repro && ./dotnet-install.sh -version 7.0.100-rc.1.22377.7 \r\n4) /root/.dotnet/dotnet build ./repro.proj \r\n\r\nSad SDK 7.0.100-rc.1.22379.1 repros the problem (Version 7.0.22.37802 @Commit: 97749c034e3a94c03c2ebfef94fa6aa4b257488b)\r\nSad sdk has MSBuild version 17.4.0-preview-22378-04+827c1bf9c   \r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug:\r\n1) docker run -v c:/scratch/hosting-bug-repro:/repro -it mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet-buildtools/prereqs:ubuntu-18.04-20220808192747-20889cf\r\n2) cd /repro && ./dotnet-install.sh -version 7.0.100-rc.1.22379.1\r\n4) /root/.dotnet/dotnet build ./repro.proj \r\n\r\n[repro.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/files/9285766/repro.zip)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild succeeds as many times as run\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nerrors like this:\r\n```\r\n**************************************************\r\n  ****??*  Standard Err:\r\n   /repro/dotnet-install.sh: line 53: printf: write error: Broken pipe\r\n\r\n  **************************************************\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
