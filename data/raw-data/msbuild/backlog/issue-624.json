  "body": "Merging master into xplat has regressed this, but I don't yet understand how.\n\nI'm seeing output like:\n\n```\no:\\msbuild\\bin\\Debug-NetCore\\Windows_NT_Deployment_Test\\CoreRun.exe /nologo /v:diag build.proj\n```\n\nInstead of\n\n```\no:\\msbuild\\bin\\Debug-NetCore\\Windows_NT_Deployment_Test\\MSBuild.exe /nologo /v:diag build.proj\n```\n\n[Looking at the code](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Shared/FileUtilities.cs#L536), `FileUtilities.CurrentExecutablePath` calls `GetModuleFileName(0)`, which should be the entry-point executable, which is indeed corerun.exe.\n\nI don't understand how this ever worked for .NET Core.\n\nThe behavior should be fixed and the disabled tests should be reenabled.\n",
