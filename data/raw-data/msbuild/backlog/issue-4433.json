This would extend beyond MessageImportance and allow me to create an error that will fail the build.\r\n\r\nI recently ran into an issue where a file was copied using hardlinks, the copy was edited but the original was not also updated because it is normally hardlinked.",

        "body": "The current \"try to sym-/hard-link the file, but if it fails silently fall back to copy\" behavior is a bit confusing; I suspect it was chosen to maximize backward compatibility. There are many ways for hardlinking to fail, some of which might be quite annoying to deal with as a build failure.\r\n\r\n\"Fail if you can't hardlink\" is a perfectly reasonable behavior. I think the best option given our current behavior is a new bool parameter (named something like `ErrorIfLinkFails`?) that disables the fallback and errors out. Would that be sufficient for your needs @sbanni?",
