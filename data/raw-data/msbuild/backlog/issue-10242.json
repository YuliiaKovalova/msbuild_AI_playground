  "title": "[Bug]: Error MSB4166 shows in about 1% of our builds in the same machine",
  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nErrors like:\r\n`16:41:57.454     0>MSBUILD : error MSB4166: Child node \"2\" exited prematurely. Shutting down. Diagnostic information may be found in files in \"C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\MSBuildTemp\\\" and will be named MSBuild_*.failure.txt. This location can be changed by setting the MSBUILDDEBUGPATH environment variable to a different directory.`\r\nare showing in our logs and stopping the build. The machine has 16 cores and 8 jobs could be executed at the same time.\r\nThe commands launched are:\r\n`dotnet restore $env:WORKSPACE/repositories/mesapitto/mesapitto/mesapitto.sln --verbosity diagnostic /p:NodeReuse=false --disable-parallel --no-cache`\r\n`dotnet build $env:WORKSPACE/repositories/mesapitto/mesapitto/mesapitto.sln --verbosity diagnostic /p:NodeReuse=false`\r\nWindows version is Windows Server 2022. Build tools are up to date to 17.10.2.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\nWe always run the same scripts in different projects, and it would show randomly. I'm attaching a msbuild detailed log. No additional error log is generated in the mentioned folder.\r\n[console.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15833135/console.log)\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe \"child node\" error never happens\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe \"child node\" error randomly happens about 1 in 100 builds. It could happen in two consecutive builds or not happen in a week, it just seems random.\n\n### Analysis\n\n_No response_\n\n### Versions & Configurations\n\nMSBuild version 17.10.4+10fbfbf2e for .NET Framework\r\n17.10.4.21802\r\nIt is invoked by this two commands:\r\n`dotnet restore $env:WORKSPACE/repositories/mesapitto/mesapitto/mesapitto.sln --verbosity diagnostic /p:NodeReuse=false --disable-parallel --no-cache`\r\n`dotnet build $env:WORKSPACE/repositories/mesapitto/mesapitto/mesapitto.sln --verbosity diagnostic /p:NodeReuse=false`",
