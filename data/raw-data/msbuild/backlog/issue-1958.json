  "body": "[This](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Construction/Solution/SolutionProjectGenerator.cs#L880-L887) writes the metaproj for the solution to disk here. But after this point there are changes made to the project, eg. a `.csproj.metaproj` reference might be added like in #1957 .\r\nMoving that to around [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Construction/Solution/SolutionProjectGenerator.cs#L735) fixes it. But I'm a little unsure because of this [comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/Construction/Solution/SolutionProjectGenerator.cs#L880-L881):\r\n\r\n```\r\n            // For debugging purposes: some information is lost when evaluating into a project instance,\r\n            // so make it possible to see what we have at this point.\r\n```",
