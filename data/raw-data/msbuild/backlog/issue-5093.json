  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nReferenced projects in the solution always get copied to the build output folder, regardless of the `Private` flag setting.\r\n\r\nProject file\r\n```xml\r\n<Project>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\public\\ShouldNotBeInBuildOutput.csproj\">\r\n      <Private>false</Private>\r\n    </ProjectReference>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAssembly of ShouldNotBeInBuildOutput.csproj shouldn't be in the build output folder. Neither any reference of it.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nAssembly and all references are copied to output folder.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n`msbuild /version` output: 16.4.0.56107\r\n\r\nOS info: Win 10 Pro\r\nVersion\t10.0.18363 Build 18363\r\n\r\n",
