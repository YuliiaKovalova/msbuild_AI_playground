  "body": "[BCTest_Repro.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16281498/BCTest_Repro.zip) has the solution to reproduce the issue, as well as build binary log in the zip file. The solution has two simple library projects with default setting that locates build output at the project folder respectively. Build should have no BC0101 warning, but build result has the BC0101 warnings telling the projects share the same output path and intermediate output path which are not true.\r\n\r\nFrom part of build log below, `C:\\ws\\test\\BuildCheck\\TestSln\\BCTest_Repro` is the folder where the solution is. It looks like something wrong with the base output path of the projects during build check.\r\n```\r\nBuild succeeded.\r\n\r\n  MSBUILD : warning BC0101: https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#BC0101 - Projects ClassLibrary2.csproj and ClassLibrary1.cs\r\nproj have conflicting output paths: C:\\ws\\test\\BuildCheck\\TestSln\\BCTest_Repro\\bin\\Debug\\net8.0\\.\r\n  MSBUILD : warning BC0101: https://aka.ms/buildcheck/codes#BC0101 - Projects ClassLibrary2.csproj and ClassLibrary1.cs\r\nproj have conflicting output paths: C:\\ws\\test\\BuildCheck\\TestSln\\BCTest_Repro\\obj\\Debug\\net8.0\\.\r\n\r\n    2 Warning(s)\r\n    0 Error(s)\r\n\r\nTime Elapsed 00:00:03.84\r\n```",
