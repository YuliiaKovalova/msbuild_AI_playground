  "body": "Hi, \r\nI'm already googleing and going through nealy decade year old threads  for hours.\r\nI want to automatically generate a Designer.cs where the CultureInfo is able to be passed to the GetString Method. \r\nChanging the resourceCulture that is currently generated is not thread-safe when multiple threads are accessing the same Designer.cs. \r\n\r\nThis is the current generated snipped: \r\n`public static string Account_AccountInactivated {\r\n  get {\r\n      return ResourceManager.GetString(\"Account_AccountInactivated\", resourceCulture);\r\n  }\r\n}`\r\n\r\nI would rather get a static method with the same name and a cultureinfo parameter.\r\n\r\nI was looking into creating a custom StronglyTypedResourceBuilder, but I really dont have any clue what to do with that. The documentation is lacking. How do I tell the IDE to use this ? Where am I registering this as a option in Properties of a .resx file ? How should the StronglyTypedResourceBuilder even look like ? \r\n\r\nAny ideas how to achive this ?\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm wrong here.\r\n",
