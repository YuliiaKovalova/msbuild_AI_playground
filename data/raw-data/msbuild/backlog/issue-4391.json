We'd probably just want to copy it into the XSD.",

See https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/nullable-reference-types.md#setting-project-level-nullable-context\r\n\r\nHere's what the compiler help says:\r\n```\r\n-nullable[+|-]                Specify nullable context option enable|disable.\r\n-nullable:{enable|disable|warnings|annotations}\r\n                              Specify nullable context option enable|disable|warnings|annotations.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think we could elaborate more. I'd propose something like:\r\n```\r\nSet the nullable annotations and warnings context for the project:\r\n- enable: types are considered non-nullable by default and warnings are produced (both contexts are enabled)\r\n- disable: types are considered oblivious by default and warnings are not produced (both contexts are disabled)\r\n- warnings: types are considered oblivious by default, but the code is analyzed and warnings are produced\r\n- annotations: types are considered non-nullable by default, but warnings are not produced\r\n```\r\n",
