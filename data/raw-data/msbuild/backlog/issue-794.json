  "body": "This error currently looks like this:\n\n```\nO:\\msbuild\\bin\\Bootstrap\\Microsoft.Xaml.targets(19,4): error MSB4019: The imported project \"O:\\Microsoft.Xaml.targets\" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk. [O:\\msbuild\\src\\dirs.proj]\n```\n\nThe first step in debugging a problem that results in this error is almost always \"look in the file from the far left of the message and see what's in the `<Import>` element\". The user could save a step in some cases if the error message was extended to add something like\n\n```\nConfirm that the path in the Import declaration (\"$(MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath)\\Microsoft.Xaml.targets\") is correct, and that the file exists on disk.\n```\n",
