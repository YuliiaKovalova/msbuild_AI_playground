  "body": "It's no small annoyance to have to know the full file name as well as versioning scheme \r\nof the tasks assembly, which has been a moving target in almost every version of MSBuild.  \r\n\r\nTo the point that I ended up creating a nuget package that gives me a `$(CodeTaskAssembly)` \r\nthat [works reliablely across all MSBuild versions](https://github.com/MobileEssentials/MSBuilder/blob/master/src/CodeTaskAssembly/build/MSBuilder.CodeTaskAssembly.props#L35-L43).\r\n\r\nSo, how about just having MSBuild automatically fill the `AssemblyFile` for me whenever I \r\nuse a `TaskFactory=\"CodeTaskFactory\"` attribute in a `UsingTask`? Or maybe even more concise \r\nyet, just give me a separate element name for it, like `UsingCodeTask` or something and do away \r\nwith the attributes altogether :)\r\n\r\nMay be a superset of what's asked for in #897?\r\n",
