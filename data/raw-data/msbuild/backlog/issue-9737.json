  "title": "[Bug]: Terminal Logger doesn't play well with GitHub Actions",
  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen running on GitHub actions, there is a lot of output (several hundred lines) consisting of `25l` and `25h25l` (see screenshot), which I assume refers to the VT100 sequences `ESC[?25l` and `ESC[?25h` for hiding/showing the cursor.\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-02-14 at 09 45 03@2x](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/357872/d27e75d4-12e6-48f2-826f-2a4d70a28d2b)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nRun `dotnet build` on GitHub Actions with terminal logger enabled.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour would be not to have the build log spammed with VT100 sequences.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe build log is spammed with VT100 sequences.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nI think the best scenario here, would be to disable the terminal logger if running in non-interactive environments, alternatively, not use interactive sequences like the ones mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Versions & Configurations\r\n\r\n.NET SDK 8.0.101\r\n\r\nMSBuild version 17.8.3+195e7f5a3 for .NET\r\n17.8.3.51904",
