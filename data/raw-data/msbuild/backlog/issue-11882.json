  "body": "Today, if you want to reference a code generator and use it, you need to do something like\n\n```xml\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\ProjectB\\ProjectB.csproj\"\n                  OutputItemType=\"Analyzer\"\n                  ReferenceOutputAssembly=\"false\"\n                  SkipGetTargetFrameworkProperties=\"TargetFramework=netstandard2.0\" />\n```\n\nin each referencing project.\n\nBut you know in the project that it's a source generator! It'd be great if you could guide the default consumption of the `ProjectReference` from within the project.\n\nRoslyn has considered adding a `SourceGeneratorProjectReference` to simplify this (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/66974) but it is complicated enough that it'd be better as an MSBuild feature.\n\nIdeally a project would be able to influence\n\n* `TargetFramework` negotiation\n* `IsRidAgnostic`\n* `OutputItemType`\n\nand possibly other things.",
