  "body": "`Project.GetAllGlobs` returns a `GlobResult` for each glob introduced by a `ProjectItemElement`. `GlobResult.Excludes` only contains the excludes of the item, whereas CPS needs it to also include all the Remove elements that affect that item.\r\n\r\n`GlobResult` should also include an `IMsBuildGlob` that could be used to test whether arbitrary strings would be matched by the include item element representing that `GlobResult`. Under the covers it will be an MsBuildGlobWithGaps, where the gaps incorporate information from the exclude and relevant remove elements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there should be one glob result aggregating the information per item project element.",
