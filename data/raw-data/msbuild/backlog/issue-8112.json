  "title": "Is there a way to check if `OutputPath` has been overwritten in a csproj?",
  "body": "I want to group most of my projects in a few output folders and I'm setting `OutputPath` in `Directory.Build.targets` using some simple conditions (e.g. test projects go to `TestOutput`). I also have a few projects that I would like to exclude from these rules as they have a custom `OutputPath` already set in their `.csproj`.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is a recommended way of checking if `OutputPath` was overwritten in a `.csproj`. The only solution I found at the moment is to set a custom property instead of `OutputPath` in the `.csproj` (e.g. `CustomOutputPath`) and when that property is set, I use it instead of the generic rules I defined. Another variation of this would be just using that second property as a flag and keeping `OutputPath` as it is.\r\n\r\nIs there a simpler/cleaner way of doing this? Ideally, I would like to be able to just add some kind of condition like `'($OutputPath)' != '($DefaultOutputPath)', but I don't think this exists (or at least I haven't found it yet).",
