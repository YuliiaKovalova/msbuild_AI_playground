BuildBoss and the log viewer's multi-writes view are woefully incomplete, especially once more-complex tasks and targets get involved.\r\n\r\nTo be complete, we'd need traced I/O at a variety of levels, like [BuildXL](https://github.com/microsoft/BuildXL) has. Plumbing that into MSBuild is not feasible.\r\n\r\nWe should add a warning wave for the low-hanging fruit here, though.",

I wrote a similar tool reading binlogs that supports a baseline of the current issues to protect from regressions and new instances. Hope to add it in a more general form to one of Kirill's build tools later this year.",
