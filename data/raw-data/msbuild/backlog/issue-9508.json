  "body": "### Summary\n\nThere are various ways to suppress warnings and (at least internally) we mix and match all of them. Some of this is for legacy and historical reasons, but docs could help describe what the current recommendations are.\r\n\r\nExample of various mechanisms:\r\n* `<NoWarn>`\r\n* `<MSBuildWarningsAsMessages>`\r\n* Custom warning suppression loggers (!!)\r\n\r\nThe doc could also probably describe making warnings into errors and other various error/warning level configurations I might be missing here.\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nSee above\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nSee above\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
