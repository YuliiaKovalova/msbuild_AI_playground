The best approach would be to add support for this to the formatter and run it on our codebase. CoreFx, CoreClr, Roslyn and various other projects would benefit then too.\n",

(GH: https://github.com/yongfa365/BatchFormat)\nOnce installed, open VS solution, close all files, right-click solution node in `Solution Explorer` and select: `Batch Format > Remove and Sort Usings and Format Document`. Problem solved! :)\n\nAlso, if you have `.editorconfig` in project root (https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-visualstudio#readme), the BatchFormat extension will work as expected, as it calls IDE's default formatter to format the document.\n\nLast but not the least, if you throw a `.gitattributes` file (containing same formatting rules) to the root of the repo, the folks using *nix contributing to this repo will never publish C# file without CRLF, yet there won't be no dis-ambiguity. Ex: https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2015/blob/master/.gitattributes.\n(hint: git does push-time formatting, so the code formatting in the repo remain consistent)\n\nPS: now if `dotnet/CodeFormatter` is able to somehow acknowledge/engage all those artifacts (by providing export/import  .editorconfig/.gitattributes), that would be _super rad_! :sunglasses: \n",
