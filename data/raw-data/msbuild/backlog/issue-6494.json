All off below has to be somehow addressed for MSBuild V1 to be turned on by default:\r\n- [ ] Not logging some properties -  https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6609\r\n- [ ] Static graph restore can cause subsequent builds to fail - https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/6602\r\n- [ ] Dogfooding in Arcade was failing on linux builds - installer repo on branch `origin/updateStage0` sha `a6e9cdf432fc3f403886dea7fa80b1ea7471eba3` was failing with `./build.sh /v:detailed` on linux with error `The project file could not be loaded. Data at the root level is invalid`\r\n- [ ] Missing log messages - when extension erroneously using Console.WriteLine as oppose to Logger.LogMessage - such messages will not make it out of ANY out-of-proc node\r\n",
