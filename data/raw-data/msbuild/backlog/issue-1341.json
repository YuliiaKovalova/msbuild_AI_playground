  "title": "Reduce exceptions when executing intrinsic functions",
  "body": "Whenever MSBuild is trying to interpret an expression string like `$(Property.Substring(0, 2))` it will first try to reflect invoke `Substring` with string arguments `new []{\"0\", \"2\"}`, have the invoke throw a `MethodMissingException` because there is no String.Substring(string, string) method, and then try to eventually coerce the arguments into `new []{0, 2}` and invoke `Substring` again, which would now succeed.\r\n\r\nThis is slow, and makes it hard to debug VS or MSBuild.\r\n\r\nWe should redo the logic to avoid the exception. Maybe directly reflect into the receiver's type and match the method instead of first blindly calling it with strings.\r\n\r\nThe caveat here is the nature of data. If most of the time builds end up calling intrinsic functions which only take strings, then the current \"exceptional\" code would actually be faster than reflecting into the receiver to find the proper argument types. We should first build an empty console project and some real, big projects to get a sense of the landscape.",
