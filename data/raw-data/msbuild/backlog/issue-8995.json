  "title": "[Feature Request]: Support 'Internal' Targets that cannot be invoked from outside the project",
  "body": "### Summary\n\nWriting modular encapsulated functionality in MSBuild is sometimes difficult. A given operation may require a chain of targets where the individual targets aren't standalone and are expected to be used in concert. But all targets available on a project can be invoked on the project.\r\n\r\nIf the targets on a project are thought of being like class methods, all the methods are public.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have support for being able to make a target 'Internal' to a project, i.e. not public.\r\n\r\n(If this has been proposed before, I searched and failed to find the prior issue or feature request.)\n\n### Background and Motivation\n\nA common pattern in MSBuild is a target that defines a chain of targets and has no body, e.g.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"DoSomething\" DependsOnTargets=\"_DefineSomethingProps;_PrepareSomething;_DoSomething;_FinallySomething\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach of the targets in the chain can have error checking and `BeforeTargets`, `AfterTargets`, and/or `DependsOnTargets` attributes  to ensure they all run and all run in the correct order, regardless of which target is invoked.\r\n\r\nBut it may also be desirable to prevent the `_DefineSomethingProps`, `_PrepareSomething`, `_DoSomething`, and `_FinallySomething` targets from being invoked from outside the project. The `DoSomething` target would be the exposed public 'command'.\n\n### Proposed Feature\n\nIntroduce a new optional attribute for the `Target` element. The attribute might be named `Internal`, expect a Boolean value, and default to `false` when the attribute is not present. Existing code would not be impacted.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <Target Name=\"_DefineSomethingProps\" Internal=\"true\" ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `Internal` is `true`, MSBuild will prevent the target from being invoked from outside the project.\r\n- Passing the name of an 'internal' target via the `/t` switch of the command line should be an error.\r\n- Passing the name of an 'internal' target via the `Targets` attribute of the `MSBuild` task should be an error.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\n_No response_",
