  "body": "> At the moment, I don't have a good guess because `DOTNET_CLI_DO_NOT_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` isn't mentioned in any .binlog from the build that I checked. It feels like environment variables that aren't directly used in the build (e.g. `COMPlus_DbgEnableMiniDump` in our other jobs) aren't logged anymore. That leaves me w/ insufficient information to debug the problem.\r\n> \r\n> The suggestion in Structured Log viewer is to\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> Define a value for MSBUILDLOGALLENVIRONMENTVARIABLES to log all environment variables. Only those used in evaluating properties are currently logged.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> but that's very time-consuming when it takes a CI build to reproduce the problem. This feels like a regression @rainersigwald.\r\n> \r\n> Should we unconditionally add `MSBUILDLOGALLENVIRONMENTVARIABLES: true` in all CI jobs that may produce binary logs\u2754\r\n\r\nWe should add an allowlist for `MSBUILD*`, `COMPlus_*`, and `DOTNET_*` variables at the bare minimum. (`DOTNET_*` is a synonym for `COMPLUS_*` now).\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @rainersigwald in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/43028#issuecomment-1230617069_",
