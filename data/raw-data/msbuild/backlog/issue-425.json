We had an internal bug where the .exe was actually not present on disk, but the error was just:\n\n```\n1>Task \"SignFile\" (TaskId:43)\n1>  Task Parameter:CertificateThumbprint=AAD0491335D003B4BAE60CCCEE28EC62600D224D (TaskId:43)\n1>  Task Parameter:SigningTarget=bin\\Debug\\app.publish\\\\setup.exe (TaskId:43)\n1>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v14.0\\OfficeTools\\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Office.targets(609,9): error MSB3482: An error occurred while signing: SignTool.exe not found.\n1>Done executing task \"SignFile\" -- FAILED. (TaskId:43)\n```\n\nWould have been nice to know where it was looking!\n",
