  "title": "[Feature Request] Report build times for referenced projects during build",
  "body": "In a large solution it is typical to have multiple projects. The more projects, the longer the build time.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to know how long each project takes to build, so that one can look for bottlenecks. However that info is not revealed.\r\n\r\nA typical example:\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet build\r\nMSBuild version 17.7.4+3ebbd7c49 for .NET\r\n  Determining projects to restore...\r\n  All projects are up-to-date for restore.\r\n  \r\n  Common -> /home/username/MyProjects/Common/bin/Debug/net7.0/Common.dll\r\n  Core -> /home/username/MyProjects/Core/bin/Debug/net7.0/Core.dll\r\n  UI -> /home/username/MyProjects/UI/bin/Debug/net7.0/UI.dll\r\n  Server -> /home/username/MyProjects/Server/bin/Debug/net7.0/Server.dll\r\n\r\nBuild succeeded.\r\n\r\n    0 Warning(s)\r\n    0 Error(s)\r\n\r\nTime Elapsed 00:02:56.65\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a CLI switch to report individual build times, e.g. `--report-project-build-times`:\r\n```\r\n$ dotnet build --report-project-build-times                                               <-----\r\nMSBuild version 17.7.4+3ebbd7c49 for .NET\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n  Common -> /home/username/MyProjects/Common/bin/Debug/net7.0/Common.dll  00:00:15.18     <-----\r\n  Core -> /home/username/MyProjects/Core/bin/Debug/net7.0/Core.dll 00:01:12.37            <-----\r\n  UI -> /home/username/MyProjects/UI/bin/Debug/net7.0/UI.dll 00:00:54.18                  <-----\r\n  Server -> /home/username/MyProjects/Server/bin/Debug/net7.0/Server.dll 00:01:26.52      <-----\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n```",
