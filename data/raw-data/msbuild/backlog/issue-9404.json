A fix would be nice]\r\n\r\ncopied from https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/8999\r\n\r\nIssue Description\r\nWe have a C++ codebase that uses CMake in a \u201csuperbuild\u201d architecture, where an outer CMake project downloads our third-party dependencies, and the inner project contains our own code and is built afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when I build the outer project, I cannot make it immediately stop via Ctrl-C and I have to kill it from the Task Manager. This hinders my development workflow.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce\r\nClone https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB and open a PowerShell into it.\r\nmkdir build && cd build\r\nRun ../bootstrap.ps1 (should not take long)\r\nRun cmake --build . --config Release and wait a couple of seconds before the next step.\r\nTry to cancel the build with Ctrl-C.\r\nExpected Behavior\r\nThe build stops.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior\r\nThe build does not stop. Immediately after pressing Ctrl-C I get an Attempting to cancel the build... message.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/assets/95473390/872c7312-8c8e-4908-bed2-0d1ce7bf2a9e)\r\n\r\nAfter some time I getting a C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VC\\v170\\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(248,5): warning MSB4220: Waiting for the currently executing task \"CustomBuild\" to cancel. [C:\\Users\\teo\\code\\TileDB\\build\\ep_magic.vcxproj]. The build will stop after the currently-building component of the outer project finishes (in this case it was a dependency, but in most cases when the main project gets built, the build is effectively uncancellable).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nI don\u2019t think this is a problem of CMake because I can cancel the outer build on Unix with Makefiles. It seems that MSBuild struggles to kill the inner build.\r\n\r\nDirectly building the inner project can be cancelled without any problem.\r\n\r\nVersions & Configurations\r\nMSBuild version 17.6.3.22601\r\nCMake version 3.26.0-msvc3\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find diagnostic information, see the [original linked feedback ticket](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1876406).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Comment from C++ team:\r\n\r\n\"CustomBuild task is derived from ToolTask (owned by msbuild) which creates the tool process. To be able to cancel a console process, you need to send it console CTRL+BREAK event and for that you need to know its handle, which is private currently.\r\n\r\nWhen cpp tasks are using tracker, tracker issues that event on cancellation:\r\n\r\n[https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/\\_git/VS?path=/src/xmake/DependencyTracking/Tracker/Tracker.cpp&version=GBmain&line=568&lineEnd=568&lineStartColumn=12&lineEndColumn=98&lineStyle=plain&\\_a=contents](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/%5C_git/VS?path=/src/xmake/DependencyTracking/Tracker/Tracker.cpp&version=GBmain&line=568&lineEnd=568&lineStartColumn=12&lineEndColumn=98&lineStyle=plain&%5C_a=contents)\r\n\r\nBut when process is launched without tracking (which is the case in CustomBuild), currently nobody sends the CTRL+BREAK event.\r\n\r\nSo ask to msbuild: either expose tool process handle to derived classes somehow (say, as some protected method) or issue CTRL+BREAK event to the tool process in ToolTask.Cancel().\r\n\r\nNote that issuing CTRL+BREAK event and waiting for tool process exit is required to avoid corrupted outputs and problems with subsequent incremental build.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
