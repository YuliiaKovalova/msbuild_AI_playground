It's been sufficiently infrequent that we haven't automated it so far, but I'd love for it to be solved forever.\r\n\r\n> * When did we know that 15.9.20 would need to be published\r\n\r\nTechnically, not until VS 15.9 went RTM. Realistically, confidence increased before that as escrow tightened.\r\n\r\n> * What is the precise package list to the published\r\n\r\nAccording to our [internal doc](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/toolsforeng/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2Ftoolsforeng%2FOne%20Note%2FToolsForSoftwareEngineers&wd=target%28Build%20Tools%2FMSBuild%2FGitHub.one%7CFF6DC598-65EC-43D5-AB29-DB38FEB82BC8%2FMyGet%20Feed%7CFAFC6258-899D-48D4-8DB4-892396202C9C%2F%29) on this,\r\n\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.Build\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Conversion.Core\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Engine\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Framework\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Runtime\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Tasks.Core\r\nMicrosoft.Build.Utilities.Core\r\n```\r\n\r\n> * Is this a firedrill\r\n\r\nI don't think it's urgent. We shouldn't have done it before VS RTM, and we have the MyGet feed with the same packages as a workaround if anyone needs the packages immediately.",
