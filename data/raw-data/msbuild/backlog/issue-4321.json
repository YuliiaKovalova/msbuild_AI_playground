  "body": "I need to installer for visual studio build tools 2017 to use setup a new instance of Teamcity, I used the installer that I previously downloaded to setup a different teamcity instance and it installed the build tools no issues. \r\n\r\nI then go to the production teamcity server to install build tools and It installs visual studio build tools 2019 (MS Build 16), I did not realise this had happened and wasted a couple of errors trying lots of remedies online, its when I checked \"Uninstall a program\" that I noticed it has installed something else. This is not ideal.\r\n\r\nSimple resolution: \r\nCan we have installers under releases for the various versions of build tools?\r\n\r\nI was going to using the visual studio 2017 installer (Which gives you the option to install msbuild) but I realised it will also install visual studio taking the installation size to well over 1GB which is undesirable",
