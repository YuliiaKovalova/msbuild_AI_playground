  "body": "In a very large build, errors may have scrolled well offscreen before the end of the build, leaving a terminal window with a sea of green \"project succeeded\" messages followed by an unhelpful \"build failed with 8 errors\".\r\n\r\nWe decided not to repeat every error because of noise, but we could consider a heuristic based on terminal height that could emit an error recap if errors were emitted but are now offscreen.\r\n\r\n(I could swear we had this conversation several times but I can't find a bug tracking it)",
