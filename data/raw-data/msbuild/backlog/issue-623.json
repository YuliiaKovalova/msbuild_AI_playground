  "body": "We tweaked how the Exec task handles non-ANSI characters in #143 and #442--it now jumps through hoops to determine when to write a file with UTF-8 encoding and a `chcp` instruction.\n\nWhen merging these changes to the `xplat` branch, some tests fail because some of the APIs we used to determine the state of the machine and of the string aren't (weren't?) supported on .NET Core.\n\nI'm going to disable those tests for now, but the underlying behavior should be fixed and the tests should be reenabled.\n",
