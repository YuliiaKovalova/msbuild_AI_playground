 The second phase of msbuild interpretation is target execution. This happens in the [TargetBuilder](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/bd00d6cba24d41efd6f54699c3fdbefb9f5034a1/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/TargetBuilder.cs#L100). The `TargetBuilder` uses a stack to execute targets. The initial state is the state contained inside a given `ProjectInstance`. So targets execute in a stack based manner and mutate the global state inside a `ProjectInstance`.
 
-What's the difference between `Project` and `ProjectInstance`? Sad story, but they are duplicates. `Project` objects are specialized in introspecting / analyzing MSBuild code and also in providing high level project editing operations. `ProjectInstance` objects are  read only. So the objects in the `Project` tree point back to their corresponding `ProjectRootElement` AST elements. The objects in the `ProjectInstance` tree do not point back to the `ProjectRootElement` elements (so they have a much smaller memory footprint). For example, the `Project` tree is used by Visual Studio to analyze msbuild projects, and to reflect UI changes all the way down to the XML elements. The `TargetBuilder` only works with the lighter weight `ProjectInstance` tree, since it only needs to read state.
