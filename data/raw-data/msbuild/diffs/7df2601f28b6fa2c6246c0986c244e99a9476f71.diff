 Only the first presented option is definitely not to be used. All the other options might possibly be used (up to a discussions if appropriate and what should be in scope). 
 
+# Special considerations
+
+* There should be no (or very minimal) performance impact to cases where redacting is not opted-in and/or to cases where there is lower/minimal level of logging. In another words - we should not spend cycles detecting and redacting secrets on log events that are not going to be loged (todo: second case might be more problematic - as loggers can decide their level of logging).
+* Order of processing and imports is important here - if we indicate secret metadata in items, the properties are processed first and hence we can miss preanalyzing (or even redacting) some data. Same applies for order of processing of the properties.
+* There are no global items today - this can be simulated by putting those to directory.props
+* Even seemingly innocent tasks with seemingly innocent logging can spill possibly sensitive data (e.g. think the RAR task, logging all the inputs, while those are just reference related info - those can contain paths that might already by itself be sensitive info).
