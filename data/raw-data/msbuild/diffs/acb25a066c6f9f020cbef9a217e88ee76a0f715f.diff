 ### File logger
 The File logger saves all the build data to a file. It's verbosity is determined by passing the `verbosity` parameter to the `flp` attribute, or the default is set to `diagnostic`, and it follows the same message display rules as the console logger.
 
-### Binary logger / build logger
-The binary logger is a bit different as it does not have a verbosity option. It includes all messages, projects and files from the build by default.
