+# Resolve Assembly Reference core scenarios
+
+This document aims to capture the core functionality provided by the ResolveAssemblyReference task when building .NET (_Core_ - pun intended) projects.
+The goal is to rationalize and optimize the task, ultimately achieving substantially better performance and crossing out RAR from the list of notoriously
+slow build tasks.
+
+## Overview
+
+RAR is the Swiss army knife of assembly resolution. Very extensible and universal, exposing over 50 documented parameters and supporting 10 different
+locations where it searches for assemblies. Please see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/resolveassemblyreference-task) and
+the [ResolveAssemblyReference page](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/ResolveAssemblyReference.md) for a detailed description
+of its features.
+
+While all of RAR's functionality has to be supported for backward compatibility, some parts are more relevant for modern builds than others. For example,
+if we focus only on building .NET Core / .NET 5+ projects, resolving assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) is not supported. In fact, most of
+the "resolvers", internal classes implementing various resolution strategies, are not used in modern scenarios.
+
+## Requirements
+
+Looking at the RAR contract at a high-level, it is effectively transforming one string array to another. It is passed an array of strings specifying the
+assemblies required for the build, and returns an array of strings specifying full paths to assembly files on disk. Not necessarily a 1:1 mapping because
+assemblies are transitively probed for dependencies, thus the output array may be larger than input. Additionally, if an input assembly cannot be resolved,
+RAR issues a warning and otherwise ignores the assembly. This may lead to the output array being smaller than input.
+
+### Inputs
+
+In a typical build targeting modern .NET (*not* .NET Framework), RAR inputs come from three sources.
+
+1. SDK reference assemblies. These are full paths to assemblies distributed with the SDK. The SDK may get the list of assemblies for example by parsing the
+corresponding `FrameworkList.xml`. Reference assemblies are passed to RAR with the `ExternallyResolved` metadatum set, which means that they are
+transitively closed with respect to their dependencies. In other words, all dependencies, including transitive dependencies, of these assemblies are
+guaranteed to be passed in.
+
+1. NuGet references. These are again full paths to assemblies pre-resolved by the NuGet system. The `ExternallyResolved` metadatum is set for these as well,
+signalling to RAR that it doesn't have to open the assembly files to read their AssemblyRef tables.
+
+1. Project references. When a project depends on another project, the output file of the dependency is passed to RAR. Alternatively, a project may directly
+reference a random file o disk, resulting in the same code path. Unlike SDK and NuGet, these references are not pre-resolved and RAR must open the assembly
+files and use a .NET metadata reader to enumerate the AssemblyRef table to get the list of dependent assembly names. The dependent assembly names are
+resolved to assembly files and newly discovered assembly files are again scanned for AssemblyRef's. This process repeats itself until a closure is
+established.
+
+The above sums up the functionality required from RAR in a nutshell. For extra clarity, note that RAR is invoked only once during build, and is passed the
+combined SDK, NuGet, and project references in one input array.
+
+## Design
+
+To meet the requirements, RAR must internally be able to do the following.
+
+- For each input reference passed as a file path, it must verify that the file path exists. If the file does not exist, RAR issues a warning and ignores
+the reference.
+
+- For each input reference passed as a file path, it must know what its assembly name is. For example, for a reference given as
+`C:\_nugetpackages\microsoft.netcore.app.ref\7.0.2\ref\net7.0\Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll`, RAR must figure out the assembly name to be
+`Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core, Version=12.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a` so it can map it back to the reference when it sees
+such an AssemblyRef in another assembly.
+
+- For project references (reference given as a path to an assembly file that is not guaranteed to have its dependencies resolved), RAR must be able to look
+up dependencies. If a dependency is not found in the assembly name -> file path map, RAR first searches the directory where the primary reference is located.
+Failing that, it then uses pre-defined strategies, four of which are enabled by default when building modern projects: `CandidateAssemblyFiles`, `HintPathFromItem`,
+`TargetFrameworkDirectory`, and `RawFileName`. Of these, only `CandidateAssemblyFiles` tends to actually be of potential use. `CandidateAssemblyFiles` is
+configured to use all `Content` and `None` items defined in the build. Given an AssemblyRef found in a project reference, for example `MyLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0`,
+if `Content` or `None` contains `MyLibrary.dll`, RAR will get its assembly name and see if there is a match.
+
+## Scale
+
+The typical total number of references processed by RAR when building one project is in the order of hundreds. Even if the project referenced everything
+that comes with the .NET SDK, consumed a large number of NuGet packages, and was part of a large solution, it would likely reach only low thousands of references.
+In the OrchardCore solution, for example, the median number of references passed to and from RAR is 317 and the maximum is 629.
+
+While CPU optimizations can definitely make a difference, at this scale I/O is far more concerning. Building upon the design notes above, here is where RAR
+has to touch the disk.
+
+- **File existence checks**. RAR tends to invoke its resolvers sequentially with the first-one-wins semantics. It returns the first suitable file that actually
+exists. As a special case, if RAR is given a full path, it checks if the file exists before returning it.
+- Assembly name extraction. Given a file on disk, RAR needs to know its assembly name, i.e. version, culture, public key token, ... This requires opening the
+file with a .NET metadata reader.
+- **AssemblyRef extraction**. For references that are not marked with `ExternallyResolved`, RAR needs enumerate their dependencies. This, again, requires opening
+the file with a .NET metadata reader.
+
+## Optimizations
+
+RAR optimizations tend to revolve around caching of information that is expensive to calculate.
+
+### Existing caching
+
+Over the years RAR has implemented several layers of caches, both in-memory and on-disk. An inventory follows.
+
+#### **Per invocation in-memory cache**
+
+Not surprisingly, RAR caches the result of I/O operations in a cache in memory. The lifetime of this cache is one RAR invocation because generally we cannot
+assume that files on disk don't change between builds. It is implemented inside `SystemState` as several dictionaries keyed off of the absolute file path.
+One issue with this cache is that the key is not normalized so a file specified as `C:\dir\file` will use a different cache entry than the same file specified as
+`C:/dir/file`.
+
+#### **Per process in-memory cache**
+
+This comes in multiple forms. `SystemState` has its own process-wide cache which maps file paths to data we need - assembly name, dependencies (AssemblyRef's), last
+modification time (time stamp). It uses the time stamp to filter out invalid entries, i.e if the last modification time stamp changes, the cache contents is no longer
+considered valid.
+
+Another form of such a process-wide cache is a low-level cache of timestamps of immutable files, as implemented in `NativeMethods.GetLastWriteFileUtcTime`
+and `FileClassifier`. The idea is that some files are not expected to be updated or deleted during inner loop development. For instance, a reference assembly that
+comes with the SDK should never change and may get deleted only by uninstalling the SDK. The problem with this cache is that the file path-based classification is
+more or less a heuristic and doesn't seem to work in all cases. Currently it is failing to recognize SDK reference assemblies under paths like
+`C:\_nugetpackages\microsoft.aspnetcore.app.ref\7.0.2\ref\net7.0`, for example.
+
+#### **Per project disk cache**
+
+To help in cold build scenarios where RAR has not seen the project yet and the in-memory caches are empty or not relevant, RAR supports an on-disk cache using the
+`StateFile` parameter. If specified, RAR will attempt to populate `SystemState` by deserializing the file before it starts. If `SystemState` has been modified
+during RAR execution, its new contents will be serialized back to the file after RAR is done. This is somewhat non-deterministic because the cache being written
+back is a union of what was read from the disk and what's in the memory, the latter depending on what other projects have been built by the current MSBuild process.
+Building the exact same project with the exact same disk state will sometimes write the cache, sometimes it will not.
+
+From performance point of view, while helping when RAR is cold, reading the cache unnecessarily slows down the execution when RAR is hot, because the cache contents
+already is in memory so there is nothing to gain from reading it again. Of note here is the fact that as of _On disk cache serialization (#6094)_, RAR uses a custom
+hand-optimized serializer for the cache file. It has better peformance than the previously used `BinaryFormatter`, not to mention being considered more secure.
+
+#### **SDK disk pre-cache**
+
+The observation that if there is no per project disk cache and RAR is cold, it has to read information about many SDK assemblies, led to the advent of the global
+pre-cache. The idea is that the pre-cache is created as part of building the SDK and distributed with it. I.e. it is the SDK vendor's responsibility to create the
+file, make it available on developer machines, and pass it to RAR in the `AssemblyInformationCachePaths` parameter when building relevant projects.
+
+The pre-cache functionality is generic and available to any SDK vendor. The .NET SDK currently builds and distributes a file named `SDKPrecomputedAssemblyReferences.cache`
+but it is not passed to RAR by default. Only a couple of projects in the dotnet organization are explicitly opted into consuming the pre-cache at the moment.
+
+The downside of the current pre-cache design is that the full pre-cache ends up being written to each per project cache file upon completing the first RAR invocation.
+For the .NET SDK the pre-cache contains more than 3000 assemblies. All of them stay in memory in the per process cache and all of them become part of the
+per-project cache file, meaning that they will be read back from disk on each subsequent hot invocation. Not only does it hurt build performance, but it is also
+wasteful to duplicate >2 MB worth of serialized assembly information in each project's intermediate directory.
+
+## Proposed design
+
+Completely rewriting RAR doesn't appear to be worthwhile. The requirements described above are for a typical build, not necessarily for all builds. RAR is highly
+configurable and customizable, thus the bar for backward compatibility is very high. There are definitely opportunities for micro-optimizations without any functional
+effect. Be it eliminating allocations, simplifying tight loops, reordering cases in hot switches, ..., there is a lot of low-hanging fruit. This by itself won't help
+address the elephant in the room: the file I/O resulting from scanning of assemblies, checking their timestamps, and reading/writing on-disk caches.
+
+For regular project references the system works as about as efficient as possible.
+- In a cold scenario, where there is no state in memory or on disk, the referenced assembly file has to be scanned for its name and dependencies.
+- In a warm scenario, where there is no state in memory but a disk cache exists, the assembly name and dependencies are read from the cache, together with the
+corresponding timestamp which is compared to the current timestamp of the assembly file. If they match the cached data is used.
+- In a hot scenario, where there is state in memory, the only I/O on the happy path is the timestamp check to verify that the file hasn't changed since last time.
+
+There is a chance that the timestamp check can be replaced with something faster, although historically we haven't been able to come up with anything solid.
+File watchers, for example, while tempting to use because the validity check in the happy case would cost literally nothing, suffer from an inherent race
+condition. When a watched file is modified, the file watcher routine is not guaranteed to run by the time we need to reliably know whether the file is unchanged.
+The exact time the routine is executed depends on the latency of the asynchronous OS callback, on thread pool availability, CPU scheduling, and more.
+
+The focus of the following paragraphs is instead on SDK and NuGet references, because there are typically one to two orders of magnitude more of them than project
+references, so optimizing them has the best bang for the buck.
+
+### Obtain assembly names from the SDK
+
+The SDK is currently already passing relevant metadata such as `AssemblyVersion` and `PublicKeyToken`, so there is no need for RAR to open the file and parse its
+.NET metadata tables to get this information. This, together with the fact that SDK references are marked with `ExternallyResolved` so they cannot have dependencies
+outside of the primary set, means that there is no need to cache anything about these assemblies. Everything RAR needs comes (or can come if it's not there already)
+from the `Assemblies` parameter, explicitly provided on each invocation. Note, it may make sense to keep a cache in memory but it definitely doesn't make sense
+to save it to disk.
+
+If we do this, then in the warm and hot scenarios where the per project disk cache exists, we use it only to cache data about NuGet references and project references,
+significantly reducing its size. By eliminating per-reference I/O for most references, RAR would see a significant performance boost.
+
+This is assuming we trust the SDK that it passes correct data and we trust the user that they don't delete or overwrite their SDK files. If this assumption is not
+valid, the mitigation would be to store and check the timestamp of each individual file. We would still benefit from smaller on disk caches, being able to store only
+the timestamp and not assembly name for intact SDK references, but the hot scenario wouldn't get any faster than today.
+
+### Treat NuGet references as immutable [shelved]
+
+NuGet references live in the NuGet cache which is conceptually immutable. If RAR takes advantage of this, it can eliminate timestamp checks for NuGet references as
+well. The risk is higher than for SDK references because overwriting files in the NuGet cache is commonly used as a cut-the-corner workaround. The benefit is smaller
+because the number of NuGet references is typically lower. The proposal is to shelve this opportunity for now due to the unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.
+
+### Don't load the per project disk cache when not needed
+
+As described above, the on disk cache is not adding any value in the hot scenario because its contents already lives in the in-memory cache. The proposal is to
+load it lazily only when (and if) RAR runs into an assembly that does not have a record in the in-memory cache. In developer inner loop, when the same solution is
+built over and over again, the cache would typically not be loaded at all, unless the developer makes a change that actually changes the dependency graph.
+
+### Save only relevant data to the per project disk cache
+
+As for saving the per-project cache, we would guarantee that after RAR is done, the cache contains exactly the data needed for this specific project. This would
+be done by keeping track of the items used during RAR execution, and writing those and only those to the cache. Having a cache that's guaranteed to have certain
+well-defined content after each build is a very good property to have. For instance, in dev box scenarios it would otherwise be hard to reliably "prime" a repo
+enlistment - the system may prime by building the full solution and then the developer uses the box to build a specific project that happens to have an incomplete
+cache and get sub-optimal first-time build performance.
+
+Saving of the per-project disk cache may be further optimized by
+- Keeping the timestamp of the cache file in memory and skipping the save if the relevant cache items haven't become dirty (i.e. the dependencies have not changed)
+*and* the timestamp of the cache file hasn't changed since the last save. In hot inner loop scenarios this would reduce the save to a timestamp check.
+- Saving the file asynchronously, i.e. not blocking the build on completing the save operation.
+
+### Don't use the SDK disk pre-cache
+
+The idea of pre-generated on-disk cache is sound. For the `ExternallyResolved` SDK assemblies specifically, though, it effectively duplicates the information already
+present in `FrameworkList.xml`. That is, it maps assembly paths to assembly names. If the need arises we may want to re-design the pre-cache to remove the major
+drawback that it duplicates itself into all per-project caches. Cold RAR would load both caches and combine their contents (currently it's either or). Until then,
+it should be OK to leave it unchanged and unused.

-The cache files contain the serialized state of MSBuild's [ConfigCache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCache.cs) and [ResultsCache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCache.cs). These two caches have been traditionally used by the engine to cache build results. For example, it is these caches which ensure that a target is only built once per build submission. The `ConfigCache` entries are instances of [BuildRequestConfiguration](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/BuildRequestConfiguration.cs#L25).

-One can view the two caches as the following mapping: `(project path, global properties) -> results`. `(project path, global properties)` is represented by a `BuildRequestConfiguration`, and the results are represented by `BuildResult` and `TargetResult`.

 <!-- cache lifetime -->
-The input and output cache files have the same lifetime as the `ConfigCache` and the `ResultsCache`. The `ConfigCache` and the `ResultsCache` are owned by the [BuildManager](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs), and their lifetimes are one `BuildManager.BeginBuild` / `BuildManager.EndBuild` session. On commandline builds, since MSBuild.exe uses one BuildManager with one BeginBuild / EndBuild session, the cache lifetime is the same as the entire process lifetime. When other processes (e.g. Visual Studio's devenv.exe) perform msbuild builds via the `BuildManager` APIs, there can be multiple build sessions in the same process.

-- For each input cache, `ConfigCache.Entries.Size == ResultsCache.Entries.Size`
-- For each input cache, there is exactly one mapping from ConfigCache to ResultsCache (on `BuildResult.ConfigurationId` == `BuildRequestConfiguration.ConfigurationId`)
-- Colliding configurations (defined as tuples of `(project path, global properties)`) get their corresponding BuildResult entries merged at the level of TargetResult entries. TargetResult conflicts are handled via the "first one wins" strategy. This is in line with vanilla msbuild's behaviour where a target tuple of `(project path, global properties, target)` gets executed only once.
+When loading input cache files, MSBuild merges incoming instances of `ConfigCache`s and `ResultsCache`s into one instance of each with the help of the [`CacheAggregator`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/51df47643a8ee2715ac67fab8d652b25be070cd2/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/CacheAggregator.cs#L15), which enforces the following constraints:
+- No duplicate cache entries
+- Bijection:
+   - `ConfigCache.Entries.Size == ResultsCache.Entries.Size`
+   - `BuildResult.ConfigurationId` == `BuildRequestConfiguration.ConfigurationId`
 
-The output cache file **only contains results for additional work performed in the current BeginBuild / EndBuild session**. Entries from input caches are not transferred to the output cache.
+Note that the output cache file contains a single `BuildResult` with the `TargetResult`s from the project specified to be built in the `BeginBuild` / `EndBuild` session, as any `BuildResult`s obtained through isolation exemption are excluded to prevent potential duplicate input cache entries; Entries from input caches are not transferred to the output cache.
 
 <!-- How input / output cache entries are separated with the override caches -->
-Entries that make it into the output cache file are separated from entries serialized from input cache files via the use of [ConfigCacheWithOverride](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCacheWithOverride.cs) and [ResultsCacheWithOverride](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCacheWithOverride.cs). These are composite caches. Each contains two underlying caches: a cache where input caches files are loaded into (called the override cache), and a cache where new results are written into (called the current cache). Cache reads are satisified from both underlying caches (override cache is queried first, current cache is queried second). Writes are only written to the current cache, never into the override cache. The output cache file only contains the serialized current cache, and not the override cache, thus ensuring that only newly built results are serialized in the output cache file. It is illegal for both the current cache and override cache to contain entries for the same project configuration, a constraint that is checked by the two override caches on each cache read.
+Input cache entries are separated from output cache entries with the composite caches [`ConfigCacheWithOverride`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCacheWithOverride.cs) and [`ResultsCacheWithOverride`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCacheWithOverride.cs). Each composite cache contains two underlying caches: a cache where input caches files are loaded into (the override cache), and a cache where new results are written into (the current cache).* In the `ConfigCacheWithOverride`, these caches are instances of `ConfigCache`s and, in the `ResultsCacheWithOverride`, these caches are instances of `ResultsCache`s. A query for a cache entry is first attempted from the override cache and, if unsatisfied, a second attempt is made from the current cache. Writes are only written to the current cache, never into the override cache.* It is illegal for both the current cache and override cache to contain entries for the same project configuration, a constraint that is checked by the two override caches on each cache query.

-### How isolation exemption complicates everything
-<!-- Potential cache scenarios caused by exemption -->
-Project references [can be exempt](static-graph.md#exempting-references-from-isolation-constraints) from isolation constraints via the `GraphIsolationExemptReference` item.
+### Isolation Exemption
+The `Scheduler` [skips isolation constraints](static-graph.md#exempting-references-from-isolation-constraints) on project references via the:
 
-The `Scheduler` knows to skip isolation constraints on an exempt `BuildRequest` because the [ProjectBuilder compares](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L349) each new `BuildRequest` against the `GraphIsolationExemptReference` items defined in the calling project, and if exempt, sets `BuildRequest.SkipStaticGraphIsolationConstraints`. When a `BuildRequest` is marked as exempt, the `Scheduler` also marks its corresponding `BuildRequestConfiguration` as exempt as well, which aids in further identification of exempt projects outside the `Scheduler`.
+* `GraphIsolationExemptReference` item. The `RequestBuilder` sets the `SkipStaticGraphIsolationConstraints` property of a `BuildRequest` to `true` if the `RequestBuilder` matches it against a `GraphIsolationExemptReference` item defined in the calling project. Additionally, the `RequestBuilder` marks the `BuildRequest`'s corresponding `BuildRequestConfiguration` as exempt to allow the `TaskBuilder` to verify exemption from isolation constraints.
 
-The build results for the exempt project are also included in the current cache (according to the above mentioned rule that newly built results are serialized in the output cache file). This complicates the way caches interact in several scenarios:
-1. the same project can be exempt via multiple references, thus potentially colliding when multiple output cache files containing the same exempt project get aggregated. For example, given the graph `{A->B, A->C}`, where both `B` and `C` build the exempt project `D`, `D` will appear in the output caches of both `B` and `C`. When `A` aggregates these two caches, it will encounter duplicate entries for `D`, and will need to merge the results.
-2. a project can be both exempt and present in the graph at the same time. For example, given the graph `{A->B}`, both `A` and `B` are in the graph, but `A` can also mark `B` as exempt (meaning that `A` contains both a `ProjectReference` item to `B`, and a `GraphIsolationExemptReference` item to `B`). The fact that `B` is in the graph means that `A` will receive an input cache containing B's build results. There are two subcases here:
-   1.  `A` builds targets from `B` that already exist in the input cache file from `B`. In this case, all the builds of `B` will be cache hits, and no target results from `B` will make it into `A`'s output cache, since nothing new was built.
-   2.  `A` builds targets from `B` that do not exist in the input cache file from `B`. If `B` weren't exempt from isolation constraints, this scenario would lead to a build break, as cache misses are illegal under isolation. With `B` being exempt, the new builds of `B` will get included in `A`'s output cache. The results from `B`'s cache file won't get included in `A`'s output cache file, as they weren't built by `A`.
-3. A project, which is not in the graph, can be exempt by two parent/child projects from the graph. For example, given the graph `{A->B}`, both `A` and `B` can exempt project `D` (meaning that neither `A` nor `B` have a `ProjectReference` to `D`, but both `A` and `B` have a `GraphIsolationExemptReference` to `D`). The fact that `B` is in the graph means that `A` will receive an input cache containing `B`'s build results. Since `B` builds targets from `D`, it means that `B`'s output cache file also contains target results from `D`. There are two subcases here:
-   1. `A` builds targets from `D` that already exist in the input cache file from `B`. This is handled in the same way as the above case `2.1.`
-   2. `A` builds targets from `D` that do not exist in the input cache file from `B`, meaning that `A` builds additional targets from `D` which `B` didn't build. This is handled in the same way as teh above case `2.2.`
+* `isolate:MessageUponIsolationViolation` switch. The `RequestBuilder` sets the `SkipStaticGraphIsolationConstraints` property of _every_ `BuildRequest` to `true`. The `TaskBuilder` verifies exemption from isolation constraints just by the switch value.
 
-**Current issue:** if multiple nodes in the graph exempt the same project file, the build results of the exempt project will trickle up and conflict in the first parent that tries to merge them. Documented in issue [#4386](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4386).
+\* Except in the following scenario when a `ProjectReference` is exempted from isolation constraints: a dependency project A outputs a cache file F containing a `BuildResult` with `TargetResult`s T<sub>cached</sub> for targets t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, ..., t<sub>m</sub> and a dependent project B uses F as an input cache file but builds and obtains the `TargetResult`s T<sub>new</sub> for targets t<sub>m + 1</sub>, t<sub>m + 2</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub> such that 0 < m < n. In this case, T<sub>new</sub> will be placed into the `ResultsCache` containing T<sub>cached</sub> to enforce no overlap between the override and current caches in the `ConfigCacheWithOverride`.

 When building a graph in isolated mode, the graph is used to traverse and build the projects in the right order, but each individual project is built in isolation.

+# Controlling references behavior
+
+MSBuild recognizes a [few types of references](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items) (here we are mainly interested in `ProjectReference`, `PackageReference`, `Reference` aka assembly reference) and offers optional mechanisms to tailor some aspects of the references workings - transitive references resolution, multitargeted references resolution, copying references to output directory.
+
+## .NET SDK projects and access to transitive references
+
+[.NET SDK projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview) by default make all transitive references accessible as if they were direct references.
+
+This is provided for the compiler and analyzers to be able to properly inspect the whole dependency or/and inheritance chain of types when deciding about particular checks.
+
+It is facilitated via `project.assets.json` file created by NuGet client during the restore operation. This file captures the whole transitive closure of the project dependency tree.
+
+SDK build tasks require existence of this file (hence the infamous `Assets file <path>\project.assets.json not found` if the MSBuild.exe is run without prior restore operation). It is used to reconstruct the `ProjectReference`s and create `Reference` items for the content of `PackageReference`s for the project and make them available to the rest of the build. For this reason MSBuild and compiler by default sees those transitive references as if they were direct references.
+
+## Access to transitive project references
+
+Above described behavior can lead to easy unintentional breaking out of layering architecture separation. 
+
+This behavior can be opted-out for `ProjectReference`s via `DisableTransitiveProjectReferences` property on the referencing project.
+
+<a name="OnionArchSample"></a>*Example*:
+
+Let's imagine an `Onion Architecture` design:
+
+```mermaid
+flowchart LR
+    Service[Service Layer] --> Repository
+    Repository[Repository Layer] --> Domain[Domain Layer]
+```
+
+Service Layer definition:
+
+```xml
+<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
+  <ItemGroup>
+    <ProjectReference Include="..\Repository\Repository.csproj" />
+  </ItemGroup>
+
+  <PropertyGroup>
+    <TargetFramework>net48</TargetFramework>
+    <LangVersion>10</LangVersion>
+    <!-- This prevents referencing types from transitive project references. -->
+    <DisableTransitiveProjectReferences>true</DisableTransitiveProjectReferences>
+  </PropertyGroup>
+</Project>
+```
+
+```csharp
+namespace Service;
+	
+public class PersonsAccessor
+{
+    private Repository.Persona _persona;
+    // This is allowed unless DisableTransitiveProjectReferences=true is passed into build.
+    // private Domain.PersonTable _tbl;
+}
+```
+
+## Access to transitive package references
+
+The transitive access to references works by default for package references as well. This can be opted out for referencing projects via `PrivateAssets=compile` on the `PackageReference` of the concern. (More details on [Controlling package dependency assets](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#controlling-dependency-assets)).
+
+When using this metadatum - the access to the package, its dirrect and transitive dependencies is **not** restricted for the project declaring the refenerence on the package in its `Project` element. It is restricted for the projects referencing the project (or package) that specified the `PackageRegerence` with the `PrivateAssets` metadatum.
+
+*Example*:
+
+In our previous example let's have `Repository Layer` reference `newtonsoft.json`:
+
+```mermaid
+flowchart LR
+    Service[Service Layer] --> Repository
+    Repository[Repository Layer] --> newtonsoft.json[newtonsoft.json]
+```
+
+We are not able to influence access to `newtonsoft.json` and its dependencies (would there be any) in the `Repository Layer`, but we can prevent it from propagating to `Service Layer`.
+
+`Repository Layer`:
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <PackageReference Include="newtonsoft.json" Version="13.0.1">
+    <!-- This prevents the reference to be available to referencing types. -->
+    <PrivateAssets>compile</PrivateAssets>
+  </PackageReference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+Unless opted out via `PrivateAssets=compile`, our `Service Layer` would have access to `newtonsoft.json`:
+
+```csharp
+namespace Service;
+//This is allowed unless PrivateAssets=compile is set on the PackageDependency in Repository.
+//using Newtonsoft.Json;
+	
+public class PersonsAccessor
+{
+    private Repository.Persona _persona;
+}
+```
+
+**Notes:**
+   `PrivateAssets` metadatum (and it's counterparts `IncludeAssets` and `ExcludeAssets`) is applicable to `PackageReference` and controls exposure of dependencies to the consuming projects, not the current project. It is currently not possible to prevent access to package references from within directly referencing project - this is purely decision of the package itself (as it can define it's dependencies as `PrivateAssets`).
+
+## Not copying dependencies to output
+
+By default the above mentioned dependency types are copied to the build output directory during the build. There can be various scenarios where this behavior is not desired (examples: dependency is compile time only or contains a logic for build; component is plugin to a main app and there is a desire not to duplicate common dependencies in output).
+
+Overriding this logic depends on the type of the dependency.
+
+### Not copying Assembly Reference
+
+Copying can be opted out via [Private metadata on the Reference item](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items?view=vs-2015#reference) (which corresponds to the `Copy Local` property of the reference in the Visual Studio properties dialog for the reference):
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <Reference Include="mydll">
+    <HintPath>..\somepath\mydll.dll</HintPath>
+    <!-- This indicates that the reference should not be copied to output folder. -->
+    <Private>false</Private>
+  </Reference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+### Not copying PackageReference
+
+Detailed options description can be found in [Controlling package dependency assets](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#controlling-dependency-assets). Here we'll offer three artifical examples:
+
+**Not copying package dependency to the immediate output folder:**
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <PackageReference Include="newtonsoft.json" Version="13.0.1">
+    <!-- This allows compiling against the dependency, but prevents it's copying to output folder or flow to downstream dependant projects. -->
+    <IncludeAssets>compile</IncludeAssets>
+  </PackageReference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+**Not copying package dependency to the downstream dependants output folder:**
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <PackageReference Include="newtonsoft.json" Version="13.0.1">
+    <!-- The dependency is copied to output folder in current referencing project, 
+           but it's not copied to output folder of projects referencing current project. -->
+    <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
+  </PackageReference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+**Not copying package dependency from the upstream dependencies:**
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <ProjectReference Include="../somepath/MyProj.csproj">
+    <!-- This prevents PackageReferences from MyProj.csproj to be copied to output of current project. -->
+    <ExcludeAssets>all</ExcludeAssets>
+  </ProjectReference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+### Not copying ProjectReference
+
+The opt-out mechanism is analogous to [Assembly Reference copy opt-out](#not-copying-assembly-reference):
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <ProjectReference Include="../somepath/MyProj.csproj">
+    <!-- This indicates that the referenced project output should not be copied to output folder. -->
+    <Private>false</Private>
+  </ProjectReference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+Same metadata and logic applies here as it is being inherited from the `Reference` Item definition and the logic treats it identicaly. 
+
+## ProjectReference without accessibility and copying to output
+
+In a specific scenarios we might want to indicate that specific project should be built prior our project but said project should not be reference accessible nor its output copied to current project output. This can be helpful for build time only dependencies - projects defining behavior that is going to be used as build step of a current project.
+
+Such a behavior can be achived with [`ReferenceOutputAssembly` metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/common-msbuild-project-items?view=vs-2022#projectreference):
+
+```xml
+<ItemGroup>
+  <ProjectReference Include="../somepath/MyProj.csproj">
+    <!-- This indicates that the referenced project should not be referenced in code and output should not be copied to output folder. 
+         This way we basically only indicate the build order.
+    -->
+    <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
+  </ProjectReference>
+</ItemGroup>
+```
+
+**Note:** This technique has possibly unexpected behavior when referencing project with executable output type (`<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>`) - in such case the output assembly (`.dll`) is still not copied and referenced (as the metadatum name implies) and hence the types defined within the project cannot be referenced, however other supplementary output (added as `content` or `none`) is copied to the current project output folder (for .NET Core this includes `deps.json`, `runtimeconfig.json` and mainly `<app>.exe`). In that case we can combine (or replace) the `ReferenceOutputAssembly` metadata with `Private` metadata - [as described above](#not-copying-projectreference). More details on this case [here](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4795#issuecomment-1442390297)
+
+## Forcing TargetFramework of a referenced multitargeted project
+
+Consider agaoin our previous [Onion architecture example](#OnionArchSample), but now the individual projects will be [multitargeted](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file). 
+
+Repository Layer:
+
+```xml
+<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
+  <PropertyGroup>
+    <TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net48</TargetFrameworks>
+  </PropertyGroup>
+
+  <ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net48'">
+    <ProjectReference Include="..\Domain-net48\Domain-net48.csproj" />
+    <PackageReference Include="System.Text.Json" Version="7.0.2" />
+  </ItemGroup>
+
+  <ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'netstandard2.0'">
+    <ProjectReference Include="..\Domain-netstd20\Domain-netstd20.csproj" />
+    <PackageReference Include="newtonsoft.json" Version="13.0.1">
+  </ItemGroup>
+</Project>
+```
+
+And it's going to be referenced by Service Layer:
+
+
+```xml
+<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
+  <PropertyGroup>
+    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
+    <TargetFrameworks>net48;netstandard2.0</TargetFrameworks>
+  </PropertyGroup>
+
+  <ItemGroup>
+    <ProjectReference Include="..\Repository\Repository.csproj"  />
+  </ItemGroup>
+</Project>
+```
+
+Building the Service Layer will create output folders for `net7` and `net48`:
+
+```
+net48
+ |---- Repository.dll (targeted for net48)
+ |---- Domain-net48.dll
+ |---- System.Text.Json.dll
+
+net7
+ |---- Repository.dll (targeted for netstandard2.0)
+ |---- Domain-netstd20.dll
+ |---- Newtonsoft.Json.dll 
+```
+
+Should we want to reference the netstandard version of the Repository Layer in our Service Layer - we can force the reference chain via `SetTargetFramework` metadata on `ProjectReference` item:
+
+```xml
+  <ItemGroup>
+    <ProjectReference Include="..\Repository\Repository.csproj" SetTargetFramework="TargetFramework=netstandard2.0" />
+  </ItemGroup>
+```
+
+**Notes:** 
+
+`SetTargetFramework` is currently not honored by the NuGet client([nuget issue #12436](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12436)), so the output folder will contain binaries from nuget packages as if this metadata was not used. To workaround this the apropriate nuget needs to be directly referenced from the project enforcing reference framework via `SetTargetFramework`, or copied to output/publish folder via different means.
+
+
+`SetTargetFramework` will properly enforce the framework for the `ProjectReference` chain. Once the `TargetFramework` overriding is encountered it is passed down the reference chain and the `ProjectReference`s respect it during the `TargetFramework` resolution. Due to the nature of handling of [transitive references in .NET-SDK style projects](#net-sdk-projects-and-access-to-transitive-references) and the fact that NuGet client doesn't honor `SetTargetFramework`, the transitive references can get resolved and built for multiple `TargetFramework`s. This means the output folder will contain proper version of the direct dependency - Repository Layer. The transitive references might overbuild, and output folder of current project (Service Layer) might contain both versions of the transitive project dependency (Domain-net48.dll and Domain-netstd20.dll). This limitation can be workarounded by switching of the transitive project references via `DisableTransitiveProjectReferences` (same as shown in [Access to transitive project references](#access-to-transitive-project-references))
