 The static graph contains the structural information on which reference projects a referencing project depends on. But it does not contain information on what "depends" means. At build time "depends" means that a referencing evaluated project will call a subset of reference evaluations with some targets. Subset because the static graph is an inferred graph, therefore there are ambiguities during graph construction, and thus it needs to be conservative and represent a superset of the "runtime graph". The "runtime graph" is the actual graph that gets executed during a real build. We cannot know the runtime graph because that would require us to analyze msbuild xml code inside of targets in order to find the `MSBuild task` invocations. This means doing heavy program analysis, like symbolic execution. That would make things very complicated, slower, and would probably introduce even more ambiguity, so a larger superset conservative graph. So we kept it simple and only looked at evaluation time msbuild xml code (i.e. msbuild xml code outside of `<Target>` elements).
 To summarize, the static graph does not have insights into the `MSBuild task` callsites. It does not know callsite specific information such as the `Targets="Foo;Bar"` or `Properties="Foo=Bar"` `MSBuild task` attributes.
-Since the graph does not have access to MSBuildtask callsites, it does not know what targets will get called for a given graph edge.

 To infer target information we use a flow analysis to propagate target information down the graph. The flow analysis uses the `ProjectReferenceTargets` protocol (described further down) to infer how one incoming target on a graph node (e.g. `Build`) generates multiple outgoing targets to its referenced nodes (e.g. `GetTargetFrameworks`, `GetNativeManifest`, `Build`).
 SDKs **must** explicitly describe the project-to-project calling patterns via the `ProjectReferenceTargets` protocol in such a way that a graph based build can correctly infer the entry targets for a graph node.
