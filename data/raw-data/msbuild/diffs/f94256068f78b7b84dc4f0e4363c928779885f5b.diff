-Same rule can have `EvaluationCheckScope` configured to different values for different projects. If check has multiple rules (this is e.g. case of PropertyUsageCheck rules - [BC0201](Codes.md#bc0201---usage-of-undefined-property), [BC0202](Codes.md#bc0202---property-first-declared-after-it-was-used) and [BC0203](Codes.md#bc0203----property-declared-but-never-used)) - those can have the `EvaluationCheckScope` set to distinc values.

If check has multiple rules (this is e.g. case of PropertyUsageCheck rules - [BC0201](Codes.md#bc0201---usage-of-undefined-property), [BC0202](Codes.md#bc0202---property-first-declared-after-it-was-used) and [BC0203](Codes.md#bc0203----property-declared-but-never-used)) - those can have the `EvaluationCheckScope` set to distinct values.
 
 Currently the proper filtering of data is at the discretion of the Check - as the infrastructure might not be able to decide what can be considered in scope (e.g. in case of [BC0203](Codes.md#bc0203----property-declared-but-never-used) - "_Property declared, but never used_" - the property writes (definitions) are scoped, but reads (usages) are not, while [BC0201](Codes.md#bc0201---usage-of-undefined-property) "_Usage of undefined property_" needs to scope reads, but not writes (definitions). Identical input data need to be scoped differently based on the meaning of the Check). 
 
-Some checks migh completely ignore the `EvaluationCheckScope` setting - as they can operate on data, that are sourced from build execution (as opposed from build evaluation) and hence the scoping is not possible. This is e.g. case of [BC0102](Codes.md#bc0102---double-writes) "_Double Writes_" check.
