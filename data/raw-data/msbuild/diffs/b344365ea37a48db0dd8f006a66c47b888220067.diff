   - `BeginBuildAsync` may be called with or without a `ProjectGraph`, depending on MSBuild has one to provide. When it is not provided, hints about the graph entry points are provided with which the plugin may decide to construct the `ProjectGraph` itself, if desired.
 - `BuildManager.EndBuild` calls `ProjectCacheBase.EndBuildAsync` on all discovered plugins. This allows plugins to perform any required cleanup work. This is a blocking call which will be awaited before the build can complete.
 - The plugin instance will get called in reverse topological sort order (from referenced projects up towards referencing projects). This happens when performing a graph build (`/graph`), Visual Studio solution builds, and commonly in higher build engines.
-- Only the top-level build requests are checked against the cache. Build requests issued recursively from the top-level requests, for example a project building its dependencies, are not checked against the cache. However, because the build requests are assumed to be issued in reverse topological sort order, those requests should have already been built and present in MSBuild's internal result cache, provided either by the project cache plugin or real builds. A consequence of this is that, projects which are not well-described in the graph (eg using `<MSBuild>` tasks directly) will not benefit from the cache.
