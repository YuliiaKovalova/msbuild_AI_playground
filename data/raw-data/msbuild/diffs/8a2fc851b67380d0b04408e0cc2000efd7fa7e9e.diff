 # What is MSBuild
 MSBuild is a build platform used mainly for .NET and Visual Studio. When referencing MSBuild technically we can divide what MSBuild is in a few main parts:
-- Programming language that uses XML semantics to define build actions and data.
+- Programming language that uses XML to define build actions and data.
 - A standard set of scripts authored in the MSBuild language (so called 'common targets') that are shipped together with the MSBuild binaries and that define what a build process means.
-- API and command line interface that interprets and manipulates the programming language.
+- API and command line interface that interprets and requests results from programs written in the programming language.
 - Build engine that executes a build based on the programming language inputs.
 
-MSBuild also contains some extensibility aspects that mostly interact with the API and engine. These are built to increase customization and interaction capability.
+MSBuild is extensible via XML and .NET plugins. These are built to increase customization and interaction capability.
 
 This document covers all parts of MSBuild in a general manner from the perspective of an MSBuild codebase maintainer. There will be no in depth technical details, or how-to's. If you'd like to learn how to use MSBuild to improve your builds please visit Microsoft Learn's [MSBuild documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild).
 
 
 # MSBuild XML Language
-The MSBuild markup language is a subset of XML with a focus on describing a project. An advanced example of this, is our own MSBuild executable's [project here](../src/MSBuild/MSBuild.csproj).

-The MSBuild XML is built around representing a project's data. It uses various elements to do so:
+An MSBuild project file primarily declares a project's data. It uses various XML elements to do so:
+- [Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-properties) are name value pairs, they're used to store data that is used within the project.
 - [Items](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-items) are data enumerations, where single element is a string value with optional enumeration of key-value strings - so called `metadata`. `Items` represent project files, code files, libraries and most things that a project can depend on. Together with `Properties`, `Items` are data inputs to the build system - mostly to tasks or targets.
-- [Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-properties) are name value pairs, they're used to store data that is used throughout the build.
 - [Tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-tasks) are how actions are defined in MSBuild, they're a unit of executable code to perform build operations. Many tasks are defined within MSBuild itself, but tasks can also be authored by third parties by implementing the `ITask` interface.
-- [Targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets) represents a group of tasks, in which their order matters. It is a set of instructions for the MSBuild engine to build from.

-These attributes are defined within project files (`.csproj`, `.vbproj` etc.). The solution files (`.sln`) are not written with MSBuild XML. They are originally exclusive to Visual Studio and yet the MSBuild command-line application can parse them to find projects to build. It does so by converting the solution file to a MSBuild project file in-memory and acts upon it instead.

 While the project file defines the data used for the build, the actual build instructions are generally imported from a common location through the `Import` element or [MSBuild SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk) that contain their own tasks and targets. One example that is widely used is the [`Microsoft.NET.Sdk`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview) from the .NET SDK.
 
 
 # Common Targets

+MSBuild has some Common Targets that adds baseline functionality to the build. This functionality includes build management, like the creation and management of output folders and intermediary folders, defining a project's “primary output”, implementing the [`ProjectReference` protocol](ProjectReference-Protocol.md), and so on.
 
-Visual Studio also uses common targets to change the behaviour of MSBuild through UI and checkboxes, making sure that the user has access to those options and there is not a need to modify the project file XML directly. Some use cases for Visual Studio also include:
-- Population of the Solution Explorer window. Which projects and files need to be added to the view of the complete solution.
-- Executing design-time builds to populate language services.

+## Project Execution
 For more detailed information on execution phase visit [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/build-process-overview#execution-phase).
 
-The execution phase is simply executing a request that contains a list of targets defined in the XML by the user or implicitly defined by the SDK or VS. The order of executed targets is defined using a few attributes: `BeforeTargets`, `DependsOnTargets`, and `AfterTargets`. However, the order in which targets are executed during a build will not strictly follow the one defined by those attributes. During execution, if a target that is being executed changes attributes or properties from another target, the final execution order might change due to the dependency chain changing. The full executing order can be [found here](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/target-build-order#determine-the-target-build-order).
+The execution phase starts with a request to build a list of targets defined in the project (in its own XML or an import). Those targets and their prerequisite targets will then execute.

-Another target order issue arises when there is a project dependency. Project dependencies are dicovered during target execution, so targets can start executing in a certain order, hit a project dependency that has not been completed yet. In this case, the node that is processing the targets will be considered blocked, and will pause the current execution to start another project. Once the dependencies have been fullfilled, the original build resumes and the target execution will continue in the original order.

 ### Task Host
-MSBuild has an ability to run tasks out of process via the so called Task Host. That allows tasks to run in a different .NET runtime or bitness than the one used by the build engine for the build execution.
+MSBuild generally runs tasks in its own process, but has an ability to run tasks out of process via the “task host”. That allows tasks to run in a different .NET runtime or processor architecture than the one used by the build engine for the build execution.
 
 A specific task host is automatically selected when a task explicitly declares the need for a specific runtime or architecture that is different from the one used by the executing MSBuild engine. The runtime and architecture can be requested via `Runtime` and `Architecture` attributes in [`UsingTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/usingtask-element-msbuild) element defining the task or in the [`Task`](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/task-element-msbuild) element used for task invocation.

 During execution tasks might need to share state meaningfully between invocations in a single build or across builds. The MSBuild engine provides a mechanism to manage the lifetime of .NET objects to fill this gap. This lifetime can be defined by the user but has specific scopes: it can live per build or indefinitely. However, this mechanism is only available for communication within the same execution node, and it is not serializable.
 
 ### Incremental Build Cache
-The build incrementality is controled by individual `Tasks` and `Targets`. Those can define their `Inputs` and `Outputs` - and if both specified, MSBuild engine will control if `Outputs` are up-to-date via checking presence of specified files and file system update timestamps (and if outputs have newer timestamps - they are considered up to date) and skip execution of such `Tasks` or/and `Targets` that are deemed up to date.
+The build incrementality is controled by individual `Tasks` and `Targets`. Targets can define their `Inputs` and `Outputs` - and if both specified, MSBuild engine will skip execution of `Targets` that are deemed up to date. Tasks may also internally implement incremental behavior.
 For this reason many `Targets` in the MSBuild SDK, that perform intermediate operations, specifies explicit `Inputs` and `Outputs` - while flushing the outputs usually into `IntermediateOutputDirectory` (AKA the 'obj' directory). This helps to follow the incrementality of the build. The `IntermediateOutputDirectory` can hence be regarded as the incremental build cache - though it's not any centraly managed cache with a single de/serialization mechanism. Each Target controls the way how it wants to create and read the intermediate files. The Targets within MSBuild SDK store only up front know data types (no type information is being stored into the cache).
 
 #### RAR Cache
-Special case of incremental build cache within the `IntermediateOutputDirectory` is a `ResolveAssemblyReference` (RAR) cache.
-[`ResolveAssemblyReference`](../../src/Tasks/AssemblyDependency/ResolveAssemblyReference.cs) (RAR) is one of the most important tasks in the MSBuild toolset. It is responsible for obtain all references needed to build the project and resolve the full paths to the assemblies representing those references (so that the compiler task can operate on a deterministic, fully defined, input). For more information on RAR please see [the RAR documentation](../documentation/wiki/ResolveAssemblyReference.md).
-RAR stores the resolved information in the `obj` folder (pointed via `IntermediateOutputDirectory` property) in the files with configurable name with '.cache' extension. The cache content is de/serialized via MSBuild proprietary de/serialization protocol (AKA `ITranslatable`), that requires exact upfront knowledge of the types being de/serialized (means - no type information is being exchanged).

 ## Scheduler
-The scheduler is the part of the MSBuild engine responsible for scheduling work, as well as maintaining and managing the result of already executed projects. When a build starts, the scheduler assigns the entry point project to a worker node (generally the in-proc node). The project's execution starts and proceeds until the whole project ends or is blocked. A project is considered blocked, when the project that it is currently building depends on another project that has not yet finished executing. Once a node is not proceeding with the current project, the scheduler then asseses if it has more work to be given to that node and assigns it.

-If the node's operation is blocked by a dependency, it asks the scheduler for the results of the dependency's execution. If the dependency has been executed, the result is retrieved from the Project Result Cache. If the process has not been executed, the scheduler suspends the current project, making the target / project a pending request. When a request is pending, the scheduler adds to the list of requests to execute, and will eventually assign the dependency to be executed to either the current node or another one that is free.

-For multi-targeted builds parallelism is a specific case with some extra work before the build. The outer build produces a list of projects to build. This list contains the same project file with a different metadata for the target framework. This list is then passed to the MSBuild execute target so it can be built in parallel.

 ### Processes and nodes
 When a new build is started, MSBuild starts a process that runs some setup code and prepares itself to start a build. The process of defining the scheduler differs slightly depending on the environment the build is being executed. 
 
-In the case of a CLI build the first node becomes the scheduler node and one of the worker nodes, becoming both the entry point for the project build and the scheduler. The main problem that arises from that is when the whole build finishes execution, the OS tears down the process, losing the memory cache and having to restart the whole build process from the start.

The main node (with scheduler, loggers, etc.) is still being teared down.
