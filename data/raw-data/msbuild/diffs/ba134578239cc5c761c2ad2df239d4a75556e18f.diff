 ### Message types
 There are various types of messages within MSBuild with different importances and purposes.
-There are some message types that are built-in within the engine, `errors`, `warnings`, and MSBuild engine information. The custom messages, that can come either from the engine or other sources, are selected and displayed based on the `importance` of the message. There can be high, normal, and low importance messages being displayed. More detail on which messages are displayed on individual loggers are on their respective sections.
