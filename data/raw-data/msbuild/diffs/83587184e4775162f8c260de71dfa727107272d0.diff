 Powerusers are able to develop, test and publish their custom analyzers easily and contribute them back to community. The local development scenario doesnâ€™t require roundtrip through packaging.
 
-A solid set of in-the-box analyzers is provided by MSBuild and the .NET SDK, extended each release, with high quality reports (pointing exact locations of issue, offering clear and actionable explanations, not repetitive for builds with multi-execution or/and multi-importing of a same script in single build context). The existing in-the-box analyzers are gradually enabled by default and their severity increased - in waves (likely tied to sdk releases) - aiming to constantly increase the quality of our customers build scripts. To avoid breaking customers builds, there will still be an explicit user gesture required to opt into running the analysis. This will be done either by configuring the analyzers with `.editorconfig` or auto-enabling the analysis based on the TFM of the project. There will be no difference between building with `dotnet build` and with VS/`MSBuild.exe`, they will follow the same enablement rules with the set of enabled built-in analyzers derived from `.editorconfig` and TFM/props.

Building in Visual Studio will eventually reach parity with command-line build as well.
 
 Projects that don't use the .NET SDK and those that are not SDK-style at all are TBD. There is a possibility of using a property like `MSBuildAnalysisLevel` to enable some base analyzers we believe will add value everywhere.

 Here's the proposed release schedule:
-- **.NET 9** - the feature is introduced. No analyzers are enabled by default. It is not technically required to read the TFM or any other props during evaluation, though it would be nice to respect `RunAnalyzers` already in this release. `.editorconfig` can be the sole source of configuration.
-- **.NET 10** - based on feedback and testing, we choose a set of analyzers to enable by default for projects targeting `net10.0`. Depending on how we feel about the perf characteristics of evaluation, especially the "double evaluation" mandated by discovering evaluation-tracking analyzers just-in-time, we may want to omit such analyzers from the default set.

+- **.NET 10** - based on feedback and testing, we choose a set of analyzers to enable by default for projects targeting `net10.0`, and enable the feature as a whole in Visual Studio.

 - **.NET 11** and beyond - some more analyzers are enabled for projects targeting `net11.0`, the `net10.0` does not change. Everything is mature and performant enough that we are able to auto-enable any analyzer.
