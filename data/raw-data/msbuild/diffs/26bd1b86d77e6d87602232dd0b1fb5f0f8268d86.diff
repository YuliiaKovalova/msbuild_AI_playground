  ### Locating proper sources
  * Most preferable way is via `SourceLink` metadata within the nuget package itself ([documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink), [reading the metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-client-sdk#get-package-metadata))

  This is the most challenging part of the story - as .NET ecosystem currently doesn't enforce custom build pre-requisities standards nor conventions and hence it is not possible to replicate the package build process without possible manual steps. This part will hence be 'best efforts' with sensible communication of issues to user. 
  
  We envision multiple options to achieve this goal (with possibility of fallback/combination of multiple approaches):
- * Option A: Using Pdb info/ Roslyn to extract information from PE/Pdbs and reconstruct the compilation ([roslyn experimental code](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Tools/BuildValidator/Program.cs#L268), [NugetPackageExplorer SymbolValidator](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer/blob/main/Core/SymbolValidation/SymbolValidator.cs#L145)). Access to symbol files (whether published as .snupkg on nuget.org or on microsoft or corporate symbols servers) is crucial for this method. As well as usage of particualr compiler toolchain used to generate the inspected package (**TBD** - what minimal version do we need for .NET (?[5.0.3 or MSBuild 16.10](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer/commit/a272c8c314257dfa99c6befd2cfeff39b8a6ecbe), what we need for .NET Framework (if supporrted at all)?)

  * Option B: Sources crawling and finding project by name/assembly name; build; compare results
  * Option C: Working backwards from the nuget (finding pack script or msbuild properties indicating nuget creation ...); build; compare results
  * Option D: Seting up convention for explicit description of build prerequisites and package build. Inspiration for this can be `.proj` files describing external dependencies build recipe in dotnet source build ([sample build descriptions](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-externals/tree/main/repos))
 
+
+**Gotchas:**
+ * The `Option A` above infers the 'compile recipe', but not the 'build recipe' - which means some checked out files would not have their standard expected functionality (they would be completely ignored) - resource files (`.resx`), templates for code generators (`.tt`, `.aspx`, `.xaml`, etc.) and most importantly the project file itself (`.csproj`/`.fsproj`/`.vbproj`/...).
+
+   Possible solutions: 
+    * (short term) Mark such files read-only, add explicit pre-compilation check throwing error if hash of such a file changes 
+    * (long term) For code generators we can extend SourceLink to add info to symbol file what code generator was used and store it on symbols server (or in Executable Image Search Path location)
+    * project files - ??? (though one)
+
+ * Discrepancies between the `PackageReference` and `ProjectReference` configurability and behavior (different metadata support, different behavior for some of the same metadata, different layout of the the bin outputs yielding some assumptions breaks, nuget support for packaged props/targets, etc.)
+
+    Possible solutions: Those differences needs to be researched/catalogued and categorized first, then we can decide what to consolidate and what will not be explicitly supported.

  * Nuget - [NugetPackageExplorrer](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer) - as it currently heavily uses custom code to extract information from PE/Pdb metadata.
