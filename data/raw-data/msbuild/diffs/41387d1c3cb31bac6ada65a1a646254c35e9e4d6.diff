+There are two issues that arise from such a design:
 1. The configuration of the logging system should be ideally dependent on the set of the applied build analyzers. Verbosity of the build hugely affects the set of logging events that are logged by default. Moreover, some events are not forwarded with forwarding loggers, depending on forwarding loggers configuration. This is done for performance reasons to allow to drop the events that are not consumed by any of the central loggers. We need to ensure that the events required for the analyzers to work pass through. For that we need to have information about active rules from the `.editorconfig` file and the declarations in the project files via PackageReference when setting up the logging system.
 2. There is no synchronization between build manager and logging service. When the build check acquisition events get to the main node, most of the build might have been already finished on worker nodes.
