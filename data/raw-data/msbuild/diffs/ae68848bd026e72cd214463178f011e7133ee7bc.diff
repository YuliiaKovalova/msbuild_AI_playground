-MSBuild currently builds with a prerelease version of .NET Core 1.0. It requires the [.NET Core prerequisites](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md), which you can acquire manually or easily get by [installing the .NET Core SDK](https://dot.net/core).
+[.NET Core prerequisites](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md).
 
 * *OpenSSL*: MSBuild uses the .Net CLI to download Nuget packages during its build process. The CLI requires a recent OpenSSL library available in `/usr/lib`. This can be downloaded using [brew](http://brew.sh/) on OS X (`brew install openssl`) and apt-get (`apt-get install openssl`) on Ubuntu, or [building from source](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#Mac). If you use a different package manager and see an error that says `Unable to load DLL 'System.Security.Cryptography.Native'`, `dotnet` may be looking in the wrong place for the library.

 ## Getting .Net Core MSBuild binaries without building the code ##
 The best way to get .NET Core MSBuild is through the [dotnet CLI](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/), which redistributes us. It's not always the very very latest but they take regular drops. After installing it, you can use MSBuild through `dotnet build` or by manual invocation of the `MSBuild.dll` in the dotnet distribution.

-### Debugging a test
-Add a `Console.ReadKey` in the test and manually invoke it via xunit. Example:

 ## Required Software

+** Latest Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 **
 
-This version of MSBuild closely aligns to the version that ships with Visual Studio 2015. You may be able to build and debug with Visual Studio 2013, but using Visual Studio 2015 is recommended. You can download the community edition from [https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).

-> MSBuild requires that you have the Windows SDK plugin installed with Visual Studio 2015. Make sure you have the plugin selected when installing Visual Studio. You can also modify your existing VS installation by running the installer again. ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3347530/10229970/69396342-6840-11e5-8ef6-1f4434c4b36f.png)

-> Please note this is intending as a standalone build engine, not integrated with Visual Studio. We may add support/documentation for that scenario if we see community interest for it.
+All command line usage must be done from a Visual Studio developer command prompt.
 
 ## Getting the code
 
 1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild.git`
-2. Build on the command line: `cibuild.cmd --target Full --scope Compile --bootstrap-only`
-3. Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2015 (`src/MSBuild.sln`).

 # Running Unit Tests
 To run the unit tests from Visual Studio:
 
-1. Open the MSBuild solution file (`src/MSBuild.sln`) in Visual Studio 2015.
+1. Open the MSBuild solution file (`MSBuild.dev.sln`) in Visual Studio.
 2. Open the Test menu -> Windows -> Test Explorer.
 3. Click Run All.
 
-To build MSBuild and run all unit tests, use `RebuildWithLocalMSBuild.cmd` as described in "Build and verify MSBuild" below. That is usually the best way to ensure that a change is ready to go.
+To build MSBuild and run all unit tests from the command line, use `build.cmd -test`.
+To mimic our CI job use `build\cibuild.cmd`. Be aware that this command deletes your nuget cache. You can edit the script to prevent it from deleting the cache.
+The CI does two builds. In the second build, it uses the binaries from the first build to build the repository again.

 # Walkthroughs
-## Build and verify MSBuild
-The first scenario you might want to try is building our source tree and then using that output to build it again. To do this, you will need to have Visual Studio 2015 installed on your machine. First, open a 'Developer Command Prompt for VS2015':
-```
-git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild.git
-cd .\msbuild
-.\build.cmd
-.\RebuildWithLocalMSBuild.cmd
-```
 
 ## Debugging MSBuild 
 - Breaking into the main method of MSBuild.exe: set the environment variable `MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART` to 1 or 2: https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/MSBuild/XMake.cs#L488-L501
 - Dumping scheduler state: set `MSBUILDDEBUGSCHEDULER` to 1; set `MSBUILDDEBUGPATH` to where to dump the scheduling state
-- Example of manually running a single unit test:
-```
-packages\xunit.runner.console\2.1.0\tools\xunit.console.x86.exe bin\Debug\x86\Windows_NT\Windows_NT_Deployment_Test\Microsoft.Build.Engine.UnitTests.dll -noshadow -method Microsoft.Build.UnitTests.Evaluation.ItemEvaluation_Tests.ImmutableListBuilderBug
-```
-
-## Build a Console App
-To build a console app, you first need a drop of MSBuild (built on your machine) with all the required dependencies. To do this, open a 'Developer Command Prompt for VS2015' and run the following command from your msbuild folder:
-```
-BuildAndCopy.cmd bin\MSBuild
-``` 
-Now, just point `bin\MSBuild\MSBuild.exe` at a project file. Here's a quick sample project that will build an application that runs on the .NET Core framework:
-```
-cd ..\
-git clone https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab
-.\msbuild\bin\MSBuild\MSBuild.exe .\corefxlab\demos\CoreClrConsoleApplications\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.csproj
-.\corefxlab\demos\CoreClrConsoleApplications\HelloWorld\bin\Debug\HelloWorld.exe
-```
->Paths here assumes corefxlab and msbuild repos are in the same parent folder.
+
+## Using the repository binaries to perform builds
+To build projects using the msbuild binaries from the repository, you first need to do a build (command: `build.cmd`) which produces a bootstrap directory mimicing a Visual Studio installation.
+
+Now, just point `artifacts\Debug\bootstrap\net472\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\MSBuild.exe` at a project file. Here's a quick sample project that will build an application that runs on the .NET Core framework:
