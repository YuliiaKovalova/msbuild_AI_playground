 ### When an XSD has been updated
 
-After updating an XSD in the GitHub repo, someone with internal access must update the copy in the `VS` repo. To do so:
-
-1. Locally clone VS following the standard instructions.
-2. Locally update your clone of the GitHub msbuild repo to include the merge of the change.
-3. Start a new branch in the VS repository from the current working branch (probably `master`).
-4. Copy from the msbuild path `src/MSBuild/MSBuild/*.xsd` to the VS path `src/xmake/XMakeCommandLine`.
-5. Ensure that the commit message has a full link to the commit used to update the `.xsd` files, like `https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/commit/ba9a1d64a7abf15a8505827c00413156a3eb7f62`.
-6. Push and submit through the usual VS PR process, including the `MSBuild` team as reviewers.
-
-Example PR doing this: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/186890.
+After updating an XSD in the GitHub repo, the MSBuild-to-VS-repo insertion process automatically updates the canonical Visual Studio copy of the XSD.
