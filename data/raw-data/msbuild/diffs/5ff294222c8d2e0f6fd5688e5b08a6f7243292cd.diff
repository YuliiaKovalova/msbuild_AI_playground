 ## .NET SDK projects and access to transitive references
 
-For [.NET SDK projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview) restore operation by default makes all transitive references accessible as if they were direct references.
+[.NET SDK projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview) by default make all transitive references accessible as if they were direct references.
 
 This is required by the compiler and analyzers to be able to properly inspect the whole dependency or/and inheritance chain of types when deciding about particular checks.
 
 It is facilitated via `project.assets.json` file created by NuGet client during the restore operation. This file captures the whole transitive closure of the project dependency tree.
 
-SDK build tasks require existence of this file (hence the infamous `Assets file <path>\project.assets.json not found` if the MSBuild.exe is run without prior restore operation). It is used to reconstruct the `ProjectReference`s and `PackageReference`s for the project and pass them to MSBuild. For this reason MSBuild and compiler by default sees those transitive references as if they were direct references.
