                                         GetCopyToOutputDirectoryItems
 
     Get all project items that may need to be transferred to the output directory.
-    This includes baggage items from transitively referenced projects. It would appear
-    that this target computes full transitive closure of content items for all referenced
-    projects; however that is not the case. It only collects the content items from its
-    immediate children and not children of children. The reason this happens is that
-    the ProjectReferenceWithConfiguration list that is consumed by _SplitProjectReferencesByFileExistence
-    is only populated in the current project and is empty in the children. The empty list
-    causes _MSBuildProjectReferenceExistent to be empty and terminates the recursion.
+    This includes baggage items from transitively referenced projects.
+
+    As of 17.0, content items are copied transitively by default.
+    Set `MSBuildCopyContentTransitively` to false to opt out.
