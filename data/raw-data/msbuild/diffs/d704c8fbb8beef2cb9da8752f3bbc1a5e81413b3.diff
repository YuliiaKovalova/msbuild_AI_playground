 These features will eventually become standard functionality. When a change wave rotates out, do the following:
-1. Start by deleting the constant `Wave17_4` that was created in [Creating a Change Wave](#creating-a-change-wave).
+1. Start by deleting the readonly `Wave17_4` that was created in [Creating a Change Wave](#creating-a-change-wave).
 2. Remove `ChangeWave.AreFeaturesEnabled` or `[MSBuild]::AreFeaturesEnabled` conditions surrounding features that were assigned that change wave.
 3. Remove tests associated with ensuring features would not run if this wave were set.
