  Project A: Unmanaged, building as `win32`, has a `ProjectReference` on Project B.
  Project B: Managed, has `$(Platforms)` defined as `x86;AnyCPU`.
 
- Because `win32` can map to multiple managed platforms, there's no way for A to know what B should build as without some sort of mapping. The `GetCompatiblePlatform` task **requires** the property `PlatformLookupTable` to be defined in this case. To resolve this scenario, Project A should define `PlatformLookupTable` as `win32=x86` or `win32=x64`. You can also define this on the `ProjectReference` item as metadata.
