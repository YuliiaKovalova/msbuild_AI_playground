+    Target that allows targets consuming source control confirmation to establish a dependency on targets producing this information.
+
+    Any target that reads SourceRevisionId, PrivateRepositoryUrl, SourceRoot, and other source control properties and items
+    should depend on this target and be conditioned on '$(SourceControlInformationFeatureSupported)' == 'true'.
+
+    SourceRevisionId property uniquely identifies the source control revision of the repository the project belongs to.
+    For Git repositories this id is a commit hash, for TFVC repositories it's the changeset number, etc.
+
+    PrivateRepositoryUrl property stores the URL of the repository supplied by the CI server or retrieved from source control manager.
+    Targets consuming this property shall not publish its value implicitly as it might inadvertently reveal an internal URL.
+    Instead, they shall only do so if the project sets PublishRepositoryUrl property to true. For example, the NuGet Pack target
+    may include the repository URL in the nuspec file generated for NuGet package produced by the project if PublishRepositoryUrl is true.
+
+    SourceRoot item group lists all source roots that the project source files reside under and their mapping to source control server URLs,
+    if available. This includes both source files under source control as well as source files in source packages. SourceRoot items are
+    used by compilers to determine path map in deterministic build and by SourceLink provider, which maps local paths to URLs of source files
+    stored on the source control server.
+
+    Source control information provider that sets these properties and items shall execute before this target (by including
+    InitializeSourceControlInformation in its BeforeTargets) and set source control properties and items that haven't been initialized yet.
