 # Summary
 
 Project cache is a new assembly-based plugin extension point in MSBuild which determines whether a build request (a project) can be skipped during build. The main expected benefit is reduced build times via [caching and/or distribution](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/specs/static-graph.md#weakness-of-the-old-model-caching-and-distributability).

-The cache files contain the serialized state of MSBuild's [ConfigCache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCache.cs) and [ResultsCache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCache.cs). These two caches have been traditionally used by the engine to cache build results. For example, it is these caches which ensure that a target is only built once per build submission. The `ConfigCache` entries are instances of [BuildRequestConfiguration](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/BuildRequestConfiguration.cs#L25).

 One can view the two caches as the following mapping: `(project path, global properties) -> results`. `(project path, global properties)` is represented by a `BuildRequestConfiguration`, and the results are represented by `BuildResult` and `TargetResult`.

 ## What is static graph for?
 
 As a repo gets bigger and more complex, weaknesses in MSBuild's scheduling and incrementality models become more apparent. MSBuild's static graph features are intended to ameliorate these weaknesses while remaining as compatible as possible with existing projects and SDKs.

 ### When an XSD has been updated
 
-After updating an XSD in the GitHub repo, someone with internal access must update the copy in the `VS` repo. To do so:
-
-1. Locally clone VS following the standard instructions.
-2. Locally update your clone of the GitHub msbuild repo to include the merge of the change.
-3. Start a new branch in the VS repository from the current working branch (probably `master`).
-4. Copy from the msbuild path `src/MSBuild/MSBuild/*.xsd` to the VS path `src/xmake/XMakeCommandLine`.
-5. Ensure that the commit message has a full link to the commit used to update the `.xsd` files, like `https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/commit/ba9a1d64a7abf15a8505827c00413156a3eb7f62`.
-6. Push and submit through the usual VS PR process, including the `MSBuild` team as reviewers.
-
-Example PR doing this: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/186890.
+After updating an XSD in the GitHub repo, the MSBuild-to-VS-repo insertion process automatically updates the canonical Visual Studio copy of the XSD.
