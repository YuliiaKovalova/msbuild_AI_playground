 The Microsoft Build Engine is a platform for building applications. This engine, also known as MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a project file that controls how the build platform processes and builds software. Visual Studio uses MSBuild, but MSBuild can run without Visual Studio. By invoking msbuild.exe on your project or solution file, you can orchestrate and build products in environments where Visual Studio isn't installed.
 
 For more information on MSBuild, see the [MSBuild documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild) on learn.microsoft.com.

+## Replay Mode
+
+Prerequisites: [MSBuild Replaying a Binary Log](../../wiki/Binary-Log.md#replaying-a-binary-log)
+
+When replaying a binary log, we can apply BuildCheck with help of `-analyze` switch:
+```
+> msbuild.exe msbuild.binlog -analyze
+```
+
+If BuildCheck is enabled, then the events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource` and new events from BuildCheck are merged into the `IEventSource`, from which the loggers get events.
+
+```mermaid
+flowchart TD
+    replayEventSource[BinaryLogReplayEventSource\nreplayEventSource] --> mergedEventSource[IEventSource\nmergedEventSource]
+    replayEventSource[BinaryLogReplayEventSource\nreplayEventSource] --> BuildCheckBuildEventHandler[BuildCheckBuildEventHandler]
+    BuildCheckBuildEventHandler[BuildCheckBuildEventHandler] --> mergedEventSource[IEventSource\nmergedEventSource]
+    mergedEventSource[IEventSource\nmergedEventSource] --> loggers
+```
+1. The events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource replayEventSource` are passed to the `IEventSource mergedEventSource` unchanged.
+2. The events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource replayEventSource` are passed to `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler` in order to produce new events from BuildCheck.
+3. The `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler` uses the `IEventSource mergedEventSource` to invoke new events.
+
+`BuildCheckBuildEventHandler` is an internal infrastructural class and serves as an entry point for producing new events from BuildCheck.
+
 ## Handling the Distributed Model
 
 We want to get some benefits (mostly inbox analyzers agility) from hosting BuildCheck infrastructure in worker nodes, but foremost we should prevent leaking the details of this model into public API and OM, until we are sure we cannot achieve all goals from just scheduler node from `BuildEventArgs` (which will likely never happen - as the build should be fully reconstructable from the `BuildEventArgs`).

+#### Important Notice:
+Users should not add untrusted build analyzers to their projects. The use of untrusted or unverified 3rd party analyzers can introduce security risks and vulnerabilities into the build process. Always ensure that any build analyzers integrated into your projects come from reputable sources and have been thoroughly vetted.
+
+To ensure a secure and reliable build environment, the following steps should be taken:
+
+#### Use Dedicated Security Tools:
+Utilize specialized security tools and services to scan and monitor 3rd party analyzer packages and their dependencies. 
+#### Regular Updates:
+Ensure that all 3rd party packages and dependencies are regularly updated to the latest versions, which often include security patches and vulnerability fixes.
+
+#### Vendor Documentation and Support:
+Refer to the official documentation and support channels provided by the developers of the 3rd party analyzer packages. They may offer guidance and tools for managing security and addressing vulnerabilities.
+
+#### Internal Security Policies:
+Implement internal policies and processes for the assessment and mitigation of security risks associated with using 3rd party packages. This can include regular security audits, dependency management protocols, and automated vulnerability scanning during the build process.

+
+"Two projects should not share their OutputPath nor IntermediateOutputPath locations"
+
+It is not recommended to share output path nor intermediate output path between multiple projects. Such practice can lead to silent overwrites of the outputs. Such overwrites will depend on the order of the build, that might not be guaranteed (if not explicitly configured) and hence it can cause nondeterministic behavior of the build.
+
+If you want to produce outputs in a consolidated output folder - consider using the [Artifacts output layout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk/artifacts-output) and/or [Microsoft.Build.Artifacts SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/tree/main/src/Artifacts).
+
+
+## <a name="BC0102"></a>BC0102 - Double writes.
+
+"Two tasks should not write the same file"
+
+This is a similar problem as ['BC0101 - Shared output path'](#BC0101) - however with higher granularity. It is not recomended that multiple tasks attempt to write to a single file - as such behavior might lead to nondeterminism of a build (as result can be dependent on the order of the tasks execution if those belong to independent projects) or/and to a lost updates.
+
+If you want multiple tasks to update file in a one-by-one pipeline fashion, it is recommended to give each intermediate output a distinct name - preventing silent mixups if any of the tasks in the chain are skipped or removed.
