 ## Capturing Binary Logs Through Visual Studio
 ### (Preferred way) Capturing logs for all MSBuild invocations

+Via setting `MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE` environment variable to `'1'` and (optionaly) `MSBUILDDEBUGPATH` to an existing destination folder to store the captured logs and starting the Visual Studio from the same shell to inherit the environment:

+`cmd:`
 ```
 > SET MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE=1
+> SET MSBUILDDEBUGPATH=C:\MSBuildReproLogs
 > devenv.exe MySolution.sln
 ```
 
+`PowerShell:`

+> $env:MSBUILDDEBUGENGINE = 1

 MSBuild binary logs are then captured to a location specified via `MSBUILDDEBUGPATH` environment variable (or defaults to `MSBuild_Logs` subfolder of a current folder or `%temp%`, based on access rights).
 
 âš  NOTE: logs are being recorded for each MSBuild invocation (including design time builds) and kept in the folder without removing older ones - so the number of log files can grow quickly. It is recommended to set the opt-in environment variable only for the short duration of reproducing the issue to be investigated (though it is understandable that some nondeterministic issues might need multiple reproduction attempts)
