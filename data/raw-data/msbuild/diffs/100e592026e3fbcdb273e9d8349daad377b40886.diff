 Sometimes it's useful to patch your copy of Visual Studio in order to test or debug your local MSBuild changes from Visual Studio. You can use the [Deploy-MSBuild script](../Deploy-MSBuild.md) for copying your locally built MSBuild binaries over the MSBuild binaries shipping with Visual Studio. Example usage:
 ```
 # bootstrap build
-.\build.cmd /p:CreateBootstrap=true
+.\build.cmd
 
 # copy the bootstrap build output over the MSBuild binaries in Visual Studio
