    * Disable node reuse (`/nodeReuse:false`). Don't leave MSBuild.exe processes hanging around (and possibly locking files) after the build completes. See more details in MSBuild command line help (/?). See also `MSBUILDDISABLENODEREUSE=1` below. Note that using this when building repeatedly will cause slower builds.
