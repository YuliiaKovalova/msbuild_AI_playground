-Although .editorconfig shall be part of trusted sources, and hence not
-malicious, .editorconfig is looked up in parent folders up to the root.
-This can allow attacked to store malicious editor config up in parent
-folders with intent of disabling an analyzer or cause build malfunction
-for any reason.
