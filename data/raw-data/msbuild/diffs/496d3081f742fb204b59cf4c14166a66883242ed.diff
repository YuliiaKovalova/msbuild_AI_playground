+# MSBuild 16.10.0
+
+This version of MSBuild will with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.10.0 and .NET SDK 5.0.300.
+
+## What's new
+
+* MSBuild now targets .NET 5.0 and .NET Framework 4.7.2.
+* MSBuild is faster and uses less memory.
+* Binary logs are smaller and have less performance overhead.
+* Tasks can now opt into resource management to improve parallelism in large builds.
+
+## Detailed release notes
+
+### Added
+
+* Projects can now specify `AdditionalTargetFrameworkInfoProperty` items to indicate that referencing projects should get those properties exposed as `AdditionalPropertiesFromProject` metadata on resolved reference items. (#5994).
+* The `Unzip` task now accepts `Include` and `Exclude` arguments to filter what is extracted from the zip file (#6018). Thanks, @IvanLieckens!
+* The `-graph:noBuild` command line argument can be used to validate that a graph is buildable without actually building it (#6016).
+* When building a solution filter, `$(SolutionFilterName)` is now defined (#6171).
+* `TaskParameterEventArgs` allow logging task parameters and values in a compact, structured way (#6155). Thanks, @KirillOsenkov!
+* ClickOnce publish now supports Ready To Run (#6244).
+* .NET 5.0 applications may now specify a toolset configuration file (#6220).
+* `ResolveAssemblyReferences` can now consume information about assemblies distributed as part of the SDK (#6017).
+* Allow constructing a `ProjectInstance` from a `ProjectLink` (#6262).
+* Introduce cross-process resource management for tasks (#5859).
+* `ProjectEvaluationFinished` now has fields for properties and items (#6287). Thanks, @KirillOsenkov!
+* `WriteCodeFragment` can now write assembly attributes of specified types, and infers some common types (#6285). Thanks, @reduckted!
+
+### Changed
+
+* String deduplication is now much more sophisticated, reducing memory usage (#5663).
+* Improved memory usage and JIT time on MSBuild on .NET 5.0 and higher (#6126, #6189).
+* Refactoring and performance improvements in `ResolveAssemblyReferences` (#5929, #6094).
+* Binary logs now store strings only once, dramatically reducing log size (#6017). Thanks, @KirillOsenkov!
+* Refactoring and code cleanup (#6120, #6159, #6158, #6282). Thanks, @Nirmal4G!
+* `Span<T>`-based methods are used on .NET Framework MSBuild as well as .NET 5.0 (#6130).
+* Improved `MSB4064` error to include information about the loaded task that didn't have the argument (#5945). Thanks, @BartoszKlonowski!
+* Performance improvements in inter-node communication (#6023). Thanks, @KirillOsenkov!
+* Performance improvements in matching items based on metadata (#6035), property expansion (#6128), glob evaluation (#6151), enumerating files (#6227).
+* When evaluated with `IgnoreInvalidImports`, _empty_ imports are also allowed (#6222).
+* `Log.HasLoggedError` now respects `MSBuildWarningsAsErrors` (#6174).
+* `TargetPath` metadata is now respected on items that copy to output directories, and takes precedence over `Link` (#6237).
+* The `Restore` operation now fails when SDKs are unresolvable or no `Restore` target exists (#6312).
+
+### Fixed
+
+* Inconsistencies between `XamlPreCompile` and the `CoreCompile` C# compiler invocation (#6093). Thanks, @huoyaoyuan!
+* Wait for child nodes to exit before exiting the entry-point node in VSTest scenarios (#6053). Thanks, @tmds!
+* Fix bad plugin EndBuild exception handling during graph builds (#6110).
+* Allow specifying `UseUtf8Encoding` in `ToolTask`s (#6188).
+* Failures on big-endian systems (#6204). Thanks, @uweigand!
+* 64-bit `al.exe` is used when targeting 64-bit architectures (#6207).
+* Improved error messages when encountering a `BadImageReferenceException` in `ResolveAssemblyReferences` (#6240, #6270). Thanks, @FiniteReality!
+* Escape special characters in `Exec`â€™s generated batch files, allowing builds as users with some special characters in their Windows username (#6233).
+* Permit comments and trailing commas in solution filter files (#6346).
+
