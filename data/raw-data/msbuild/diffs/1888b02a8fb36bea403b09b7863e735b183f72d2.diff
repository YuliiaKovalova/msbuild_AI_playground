 [EventSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource?view=netframework-4.8) is the tool that allows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) used in MSBuild. Among its useful features, functions with names ending in "start" and "stop" correlate between calls such that it can automatically record how long the event between the two calls took. It also provides an easy way to cheaply opt in or out, log auxiliary messages in addition to time, and add progress updates in the middle of an event as needed.
 
 ## EventSource in MSBuild
+
 EventSource is primarily used to profile code. For MSBuild specifically, a major goal is to reduce the time it takes to run, as measured (among other metrics) by the Regression Prevention System (RPS), i.e., running specific scenarios. To find which code segments were likely candidates for improvement, EventSources were added around a mix of code segments. Larger segments that encompass several steps within a build occur nearly every time MSBuild is run and take a long time. They generally run relatively few times. Smaller methods with well-defined purposes may occur numerous times. Profiling both types of events provides both broad strokes to identify large code segments that underperform and, more specifically, which parts of them. Profiled functions include:

+## Summary
 
 Project cache is a new assembly-based plugin extension point in MSBuild which determines whether a build request (a project) can be skipped during build. The main expected benefit is reduced build times via [caching and/or distribution](static-graph.md#weakness-of-the-old-model-caching-and-distributability).
 
-# Motivation
+## Motivation
 
 As the introduction to [static graph](static-graph.md#what-is-static-graph-for) suggests, large and complex repos expose the weaknesses in MSBuild's scheduling and incrementality models as build times elongate. This project cache plugin lets MSBuild natively communicate with existing tools that enable build caching and/or distribution, enabling true scalability.

 This change also simplifies and unifies user experiences. MSBuild works the same from Visual Studio or the command line without dramatically changing how it works.
 
-# Plugin requirements
+## Plugin requirements
 
 - The plugin should tell MSBuild whether a build request needs building. If a project is skipped, then the plugin needs to ensure that:
   - it makes the filesystem look as if the project built
   - it returns sufficient information back to MSBuild such that MSBuild can construct a valid [`BuildResult`](/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/BuildResult.cs#L30-L33) for its internal scheduling logic, such that future requests to build a skipped project are served directly from MSBuild's internal caches.
 
-# High-level design
+## High-level design
 
 Conceptually, there are two parts of caching: "cache get" and "cache add". "Cache get" is MSBuild asking the plugin if it wants to handle a build request, ie by fetching from some cache. "Cache add" is, upon cache miss, MSBuild providing enough information to the plugin during the build of the build request for the plugin to add the results to its cache and safely be able to retrieve it for some future build.
 
 The "cache get" functionality was introduced in 16.9, while "cache add" was added in 17.8.
 
-## Plugin discovery
+### Plugin discovery
 
 - Plugin dlls are discovered by MSBuild via a new special purpose `ProjectCachePlugin` [items](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-items).
   - These items can get injected into a project's import graph by package managers via the [PackageReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) item.
   - MSBuild will discover the plugin by searching project evaluations for `ProjectCachePlugin` items.
-```xml
-<ItemGroup>
-  <ProjectCachePlugin Include="$(SomePath)\MyAmazingCachePlugin.dll" />
-</ItemGroup>
-```
+
+    ```xml
+    <ItemGroup>

+    </ItemGroup>
+    ```
+
 - Programmatic usage of `BuildManager` can also set `BuildParameters.ProjectCacheDescriptor` to apply a plugin to all requests.
 
-## Plugin lifetime
+### Plugin lifetime
 
 - Plugin instances reside only in the `BuildManager` node. Having it otherwise (plugin instances residing in all nodes) means forcing the plugins to either deal with distributed state or implement a long lived service. We consider this high complexity cost to not be worth it. We also want to avoid serializing the `ProjectInstance` between nodes, which is expensive.
 - `BuildManager.BeginBuild` calls `ProjectCacheBase.BeginBuildAsync` on all discovered plugins. This allows plugins to start any required initialization work. It does not wait for the plugins to fully initialize, ie it is a "fire-and-forget" call at this point. The first query on the plugin will wait for plugin initialization.

 - The plugin instance will get called in reverse topological sort order (from referenced projects up towards referencing projects). This happens when performing a graph build (`/graph`), Visual Studio solution builds, and commonly in higher build engines.
 - Only the top-level build requests are checked against the cache. Build requests issued recursively from the top-level requests, for example a project building its dependencies, are not checked against the cache. However, because the build requests are assumed to be issued in reverse topological sort order, those requests should have already been built and present in MSBuild's internal result cache, provided either by the project cache plugin or real builds. A consequence of this is that projects which are not well-described in the graph (e.g. using `<MSBuild>` tasks directly) will not benefit from the cache.

-# Detours (cache add scenario)
+## Detours (cache add scenario)
 
 In order for MSBuild to observe the file accesses as part of the build, it uses Detours on the worker nodes. In this way the Scheduler node will emit events for all file accesses done by the worker nodes. As the Scheduler knows what build request a worker node is working on at any given moment, it is able to properly associate the file access with a build request and dispatch these augmented events to plugins via the plugins' `HandleFileAccess` and `HandleProcess` implementations.
 
 Note that the Scheduler node cannot use Detours on itself, so the in-proc node is disabled when repoting file accesses. Additionally task yielding is disabled since it would leave to improperly associated file accesses.
 
-## Pipe synchronization
+### Pipe synchronization
 
 Because the Detours implementation being used communicates over a pipe, and nodes communicate over a pipe as well, and pipes are async, there is some coordination required to ensure that file accesses are associated with the proper build request. For example, if a "project finished" signal comes through the node communication pipe, but the detours pipe still has a queue of file accesses which have not been processed yet, those file accesses might be processed after the worker node has moved onto some other project.
 
 To address this problem, when a worker node finishes a project it will emit a dummy file access with a specific format known to MSBuild. When the scheduler node receives as "project finished" event over the node communication pipe, it will wait to determine that the project is actually finished until it also receives the dummy file access. This ensures that the all file accesses associated with the project have fully flushed from the pipe before the scheduler determines the project is finished and schedules new work to the worker node (which would trigger new file accesses).
 
-# Plugin implementation guidance and simple example design
+## Plugin implementation guidance and simple example design
 
 The following will describe a very basic (and not very correct) plugin implementation.
 
 In practice, plugins will have to choose the specific level of correctness they're willing to trade off for the ability to get cache hits. Any machine state *could* impact build results, and the plugin implementation will need to determine what state matters and what doesn't. An obvious example to consider would be the content of the project file. An example which has trade-offs would be the processes' environment variables. Even the current time could possibly impact the build ("if Tuesday copy this file"), but if considered caching would be quite infeasible.
 
-## Fingerprinting
+### Fingerprinting
 
 A "fingerprint" describes each unique input which went into the building a build request. The more granular the fingerprint, the more "correct" the caching is, as described above.
 
 In this example, we will only consider the following as inputs, and thus part of the fingerprint:
+
 - The global properties of the build request (eg `Configuration=Debug`, `Platform=AnyCPU`)
 - The content hash of the project file

 At the beginning of the build, the plugin's `BeginBuildAsync` method will be called. As part of the `CacheContext`, the plugin is either given the graph or the entry points to the graph for which it can create a graph from. The plugin can use this graph to do some initial processing, like predicting various inputs which a project is likely to use. This information can then be stored to help construct a fingerprint for a build request later.
 
-## Cache storage
+### Cache storage
 
 Any storage mechanism can be used as a cache implementation, for example [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/blobs/), or even just the local filesystem. At least in this example the only real requirement is that it can be used effectively as a key-value store. In many cases it can be useful for content to be keyed by its hash, and for the metadata file to be keyed by the fingerprint. In particular when content is keyed by hash, it is effectively deduplicated across multiple copies of the same file, which is common in builds.
 
 For illustration purposes, consider our cache implementation is based on a simple filesystem with a separate metadata and content directory inside it. Under the metadata dir, each file is a metadata file where the filename matches the fingerprint it's describing. Under the content dir, each file is a content file where the filename matches the hash of the content itself.

 The plugin would then create some metadata describing the outputs (eg. the paths and hashes) and the serialized `BuildResult`, and associate it with the fingerprint and put that assocation in the cache.
 
 To illustrate this, consider a project with fingerprint `F` which wrote a single file `O` with hash `H` and had `BuildResult R`. The plugin could create a metadata file `M` which describes the outputs of the build (the path and hash of `O`) as well as the serialized `R`. Using the cache implementation described above, the plugin would write the following two files to the cache:

 In the example above, if all inputs are the same as in the first build, we should end up with a fingerprint `F`. We look up in the metadata part of the cache (file `metadata/F`) and find that it exists. This means we have a cache hit. We can fetch that metadata `M` from the cache and find that it describes the output with path `O` and hash `H`. The plugin would then copy `content/H` to `O` and return the deserialized `BuildResult R` contained in `M` to MSBuild.
 
 If the inputs were not the same as in the first build, for example if a `Compile` item (a .cs file) changed, the fingerprint would be something else besides `F` and so would not have corresponding cache entries for it, indicating a cache miss. This will then go through the "cache add" scenario described above to populate the cache with the new fingerprint.

 To summarize, there are two main patterns for specifying build dimensions:
+
 1. Multitargeting based. A multitargeting project self describes supported build dimensions. In this case the SDK needs to specify the multitargeting build dimensions. The graph then extracts innerbuilds from a given outer build. For example, the `TargetFramework` build dimension gets specified this way.
 2. Global Property based: A top level set of global properties get applied to the graph entrypoints and get propagated downward through the graph. For example, the `Configuration` and `Platform` build dimensions get specified this way.
 
 Why does an outerbuild need to generate speculative edges to all of its innerbuilds? Why can't it use nuget to prune the speculative edges down to the compatible set?
+
 - One big design constraint we imposed on static graph was to keep it agnostic of SDK implementation details. So the graph must not know about particular details of one language's SDK. We wanted a generic design that all language SDKs can leverage. We considered that calling nuget to get the compatible TargetFramework values breaks this rule, as both the concept of "nuget" and the concept of "TargetFramework" are implementation details of the .net SDK. If someone were to write a Java SDK, would "calling nuget to get the compatible TargetFramework" still be relevant? A solution to this is to allow SDKs to configure the graph with an extension point on "how to collapse multiple speculative innerbuild edges into a smaller compatible set", but we didn't have the time to design it yet.
 - There is a conflicting need between build everything or just building a "TF slice" through the graph. Outer loop builds (CI builds) that publish binaries need to build all the packages for all the supported TFs, so they need the graph to express all possible combinations. Inner loop builds (dev-at-work) can be sliced down to only the TF that the dev is working on in order to reduce build times. Again, we didn't have time to design how to express these two things so we went with "express everything" because that allows both scenarios to work.

 ### Inferring which targets to run for a project within the graph
+
 In the classic MSBuild build (i.e. execution of targets), the referencing project chooses which targets to call on the referenced projects and may call into a project multiple times with different target lists and global properties (examples in [project reference protocol](../ProjectReference-Protocol.md)). This is a top-down traversal of dependencies. These calls are made via the [MSBuild task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-task?view=vs-2019). When building a graph, projects are built before the projects that reference them. This is a bottom-up traversal. Therefore the graph needs to determine the list of targets to execute on a specific project `B` **before** building the referencing projects that reference `B`.
 
 The static graph contains the structural information on which reference projects a referencing project depends on. But it does not contain information on what "depends" means. At build time "depends" means that a referencing evaluated project will call a subset of reference evaluations with some targets. Subset because the static graph is an inferred graph, therefore there are ambiguities during graph construction, and thus it needs to be conservative and represent a superset of the "runtime graph". The "runtime graph" is the actual graph that gets executed during a real build. We cannot know the runtime graph because that would require us to analyze msbuild xml code inside of targets in order to find the `MSBuild task` invocations. This means doing heavy program analysis, like symbolic execution. That would make things very complicated, slower, and would probably introduce even more ambiguity, so a larger superset conservative graph. So we kept it simple and only looked at evaluation time msbuild xml code (i.e. msbuild xml code outside of `<Target>` elements).
 To summarize, the static graph does not have insights into the `MSBuild task` callsites. It does not know callsite specific information such as the `Targets="Foo;Bar"` or `Properties="Foo=Bar"` `MSBuild task` attributes.
-Since the graph does not have access to MSBuild task callsites, it does not know what targets will get called for a given graph edge. 
+Since the graph does not have access to MSBuild task callsites, it does not know what targets will get called for a given graph edge.
 
 To infer target information we use a flow analysis to propagate target information down the graph. The flow analysis uses the `ProjectReferenceTargets` protocol (described further down) to infer how one incoming target on a graph node (e.g. `Build`) generates multiple outgoing targets to its referenced nodes (e.g. `GetTargetFrameworks`, `GetNativeManifest`, `Build`).

 If a project uses the MSBuild task, the build result must be in MSBuild's build result cache instead of just-in-time executing targets on that referenced project. If it is not in the build result cache, an error will be logged and the build will fail.

That's sufficient for all scenarios except compiler servers or an MSBuild server (see below). Additionally, if the MS internal build engine supports any other build type besides MSBuild (or older versions of MSBuild), it will still need to be able to detour the process itself anyway.

 **NOTE**: Based on the complexity and challenges involved, the feature of I/O tracking in MSBuild is currently on hold and not scheduled to be implemented. This section intends to describe these challenges and be a dump of the current thinking on the subject.

 [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/detours) will be used to intercept Windows API calls to track I/O. This is the same technology that [FileTracker](../../src/Utilities/TrackedDependencies/FileTracker.cs) and [FullTracking](../../src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/FullTracking.cs) use as well as what the MS internal build engine ("BuildXL Tracker") uses to track I/O.
 
 Today FileTracker and FullTracking are currently a bit specific to generating tlogs, and do not collect all the I/O operations we would want to collect like directory enumerations and probes. Additionally, the BuildXL Tracker implementation does not currently have the ability to attach to the currently running process.

 Elsewhere in this spec the final Detours-based file tracking implementation will simply be referred to as "Tracker".
 
 ### Isolation requirement
+
 I/O Tracking will only be available when running isolated builds, as the current implementation of project yielding in MSBuild makes it exceedingly difficult to attribute any observed I/O to the correct project. Isolated builds make this feasible since each MSBuild node will be building exactly one project configuration at any given moment and each project configuration has a concrete start and stop time. This allows us to turn on I/O tracking for the MSBuild process and start and stop tracking with the project start and stop.
 
 **OPEN ISSUE:** For graph-based isolated builds, project evaluation happens in parallel on the main node. Any I/O that happens as part of evaluation should be reported for that specific project, but there's no good way to do that here.
 
 ### Tool servers
+
 Tool servers are long-lived processes which can be reused multiple times across builds. This causes problems for Tracker, as that long-lived process is not a child process of MSBuild, so many I/O operations would be missed.
 
 For example, when `SharedCompilation=true`, the Roslyn compiler (csc.exe) will launch in server mode. This causes the `Csc` task to connect to any existing csc.exe process and pass the compilation request over a named pipe.

 # Task isolation
+
 ## Problem definition
+
 Tasks in MSBuild are dynamically loaded assemblies with potentially separate and colliding dependency trees. Currently MSBuild on .NET Core has no isolation between tasks and as such only one version of any given assembly can be loaded. Prime example of this is Newtonsoft.Json which has multiple versions, but all the tasks must agree on it to work.
 This problem is also described in #1754.
 
 ## Solution
+
 Use [`AssemblyLoadContext`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.loader.assemblyloadcontext?view=netcore-2.2) (ALC) to provide binding isolation for task assemblies. Each task assembly would be loaded into its own ALC instance.
-* The ALC would resolve all dependencies of the task assemblies (see dependency resolution below)
-* ALC would fallback to the Default for dependencies which the assembly doesn't carry with itself (frameworks and so on)
-* ALC would probably have to forcefully fallback for MSBuild assemblies since it's possible that tasks will carry these, but the system requires for the MSBuild assemblies to be shared.

+- ALC would fallback to the Default for dependencies which the assembly doesn't carry with itself (frameworks and so on)
+- ALC would probably have to forcefully fallback for MSBuild assemblies since it's possible that tasks will carry these, but the system requires for the MSBuild assemblies to be shared.
 
 We also want to load groups of tasks which belong together into the same ALC (for example based on their location on disk) to improve performance. This will need some care as there's no guarantee that two random tasks have compatible dependency trees. As implemented, each task assembly is loaded into its own ALC.
 
 ## Potential risks
-* Has some small probability of causing breaks. Currently all assemblies from all tasks are loaded into the default context and thus are "visible" to everybody. Tasks with following properties might not work:
-  * Task has a dependency on an assembly, but it doesn't declare this dependency in its .deps.json and this dependency gets loaded through some other task. This is mostly fixable by implementing probing similar to today's behavior.
-  * Two tasks from different assemblies which somehow rely on sharing certain types. If the new system decides to load these in isolation they won't share types anymore and might not work.
-* Performance - task isolation inherently (and by design) leads to loading certain assemblies multiple times. This increases memory pressure and causes additional JITing and other related work.

 # Task dependency resolution
+
 ## Problem definition
+
 Tasks with complex and specifically platform specific dependencies don't work out of the box. For example if a task uses [`LibGit2Sharp`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibGit2Sharp) package it will not work as is. `LibGit2Sharp` has native dependencies which are platform specific. While the package carries all of them, there's no built in support for the task to load the right ones. For example [source link](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/blob/29b3197e824c05d03427c05d56700e4c704233e4/src/Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Git/GitLoaderContext.cs) runs into this problem.
 
 ## Solution
+
 .NET Core uses `.deps.json` files to describe dependencies of components. It would be natural to treat task assemblies as components and use associated .deps.json file to determine their dependencies. This would make the system work nicely end to end with the .NET Core CLI/SDK and VS integration.
 In .NET Core 3 there's a new type [`AssemblyDependencyResolver`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/Loader/AssemblyDependencyResolver.cs) which implements parsing and processing of a `.deps.json` for a component (or assembly). The usage is to create an instance of the resolver pointing to the assembly (in MSBuild case the task assembly). The resolver parses the `.deps.json` and stores the information. It exposes two methods to resolve managed and native dependencies.
 It was designed to be used as the underlying piece to implement custom ALC. So it would work nicely with task isolation above.
 
 ## Potential risks
-* Small probability of breaking tasks which have `.deps.json` with them and those are not correct. With this change the file would suddenly be used and could cause either load failures or different versions of assemblies to get loaded.

 We decided not to implement `AssemblyDependencyResolver` in the .NET Core 3.x timeframe because of the uncertain impact of the change. We should reconsider in the .NET 5 timeframe.

 See: [MSBuild Test Target](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/9193)
 
-### Motivation
+## Motivation
+
 The primary motivation of the MSBuild Test Target is to offer a convienent and standardardized way for executing tests within the msbuild environment. This is inspired by the simplicity of the `dotnet test` command. The proposed command for initiating test within MSBuild would be `msbuild /t:Test`
 
 Another significatnt benefit of integrating this target is to faciliatet the caching of test executions, using MSBuild project caching capabilities. This enhancement will optimize the testing process by reducing test runs which could significantly reduce time spent building and testing, as tests would only execute, (after the initial run) if there are changes to those tests. As an example running with [MSBuildCache](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildCache) we can cache both build and test executions. Functionally, this means skipping test executions that have been determined to have not changed.
 Example usage:
 `msbuild /graph /restore:false /m /nr:false /reportfileaccesses /t:"Build;Test"`
