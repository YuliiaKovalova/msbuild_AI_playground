+Transcript of a talk with Rainer - [internal link] [recording](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/fde00840-98dc-ba75-0ebd-f1ed9ca0e097)
+
+## Need for multiple processes
+MSBuild is multiprocess system today.
+Multiple processes are used in few scenarios:
+
+1) **TaskHost** - allowing to run back compatible tasks and MSBuild plugins requiring different runtime.
+Task declares (in [UsingTask](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/usingtask-element-msbuild)) what environment it expects, and if it's not compatible with current configuration (today for VS that's x64 net4) - it'll be isolated.
+
+    [GenerateResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/generateresource-task) task uses this (used to use this).
+
+   `TaskHost` is supported so far, but performance is not closely watched.
+
+   Currently, [MSBuild running on .NET Core cannot run tasks compiled against the full desktop .NET environment](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/711). Analogously, [.NET core tasks cannot be run from Visual Studio](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/4834).
+
+2) **Parallel builds** - needed since tasks can access process wide state - namely current working dir, environment vars. Those can change between projects (especially [`Compile Include`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-items) often contains relative path, without specifying `$MSBuildProjectDirectory` - so it relies on current directory being the location of the project file). For this reason node in parallel build can run only one task at a time.
+
+
+## Communication
+In a presence of multiple processes we need interprocess communication.
+
+### Messages (de)serialization
+
+Communication messages should deriver from [`ITranslatable`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Shared/ITranslatable.cs) - it dictates the both direction of serialization via single method - [`void Translate(ITranslator translate)`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Shared/ITranslatable.cs#L16)
+
+Majority of translations use custom binary serialization, there is though backfall to [`TranslateDoteNet`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Shared/ITranslator.cs#L257) method that uses `BinaryFormatter`.
+
+Event args use different type of serialization - a `CreateFromStream` and `WriteToStream` methods are discovered via reflection and used to serialize type (with few exceptions explicitly translated within [`LogMessagePacketBase`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Shared/LogMessagePacketBase.cs)).
+
+### Transport
+
+Endpoints (nodes) communicate via named pipes (Windows or named pipes API implementation on other plaforms). Communication is facilitated via [`NodeProviderOutOfProcBase`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Communications/NodeProviderOutOfProcBase.cs)
+
+The validation of transport is done via [proprietary handshake](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Communications/NodeProviderOutOfProcBase.cs#L501-L508).
+
+
+## Orchestration
+
+MSBuild consist of nodes. First spun is so called **entrypoint node**. It runs a **scheduler**. Then there are **worker nodes** - those can only execute projects. Nodes are spun by [`NodeLauncher`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Communications/NodeLauncher.cs) - this is being called from [`NodeProviderOutOfProcBase.GetNodes`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Communications/NodeProviderOutOfProcBase.cs#L186) (which can decide to reuse existing node or start a new process), that is ultimately called by [`NodeManger`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Deprecated/Engine/Engine/NodeManager.cs).
+
+`NodeManager` is a build component (`IBuildComponent`) - so it can be retrieved from build engine (via `IBuildComponentHost.GetComponent`).
+
+Node is described by [`NodeInfo`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Communications/NodeInfo.cs).
+
+MSBuild can be started from existing process via API, or via MSBuild.exe - in both cases this process becomes a `scheduler node` and may or may not run other work in-process. By default the main process has as well a `worker node` (project build node). This can be tweaked by API and/or [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables#configure-msbuild-in-the-net-cli).
+
+When MSBuild start building a project it can eventually start processing MSBuild task that has [`BuildInParallel`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/building-multiple-projects-in-parallel-with-msbuild?view=vs-2022) set to `true` (which is a default) and multiple projects to build (e.g. a project with multiple `ProjectReference` elements) at that point `scheduler` orchestrates multiple `worker nodes` via `NodeManager` (upper limited via maximum parallelization - configurable via API or CLI (`-maxcpucount|-m`)) .
+
+Bugs in node communication layer can manifest as a slow build - otherwise fully functional. As `NodeManager` is trying to setup new nodes (and failing) and `scheduler` is working with only a single (in-proc) node that it has.
+
+Work unit for nodes is a `project instance` - a project together with set of glabal properties that make the project unique.
+
+----
+**Example:** 
+
+Multitargeted project (`TargetFrameworks=x;Y`) - this will generate 'outer-build' - a project with no global properties set; and 'inner build' for each `TargetFramework` (so one instance with `TargetFramework=X`, `TargetFramework=Y`). All those are distinct - so can be scheduled on separate nodes (in practice the outer build is scheduled on a node, hits the `ResolveProjectReferences` that will produce the two projects for particular `TargetFramework` - one is scheduled on the same node, other one waits for a different node to be available/spun).
+
+----
+
+MSBuild scheduler maintains a list of projects that are eligible to run (not blocked) and list of free worker nodes (plus knows a mapping of projects already mapped to particular nodes) and maps the work. [It performs some heuristics](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7cfb36cb90d1c9cc34bc4e0910d0c9ef42ee47b6/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Scheduler/Scheduler.cs#L776-L783) prioritizing work that is likely to request more work (e.g. dir.proj files).
+
+## Scheduler assumptions
+
+Node in parallel build can run only one task at a time (task can explicitly temporarily vacate the node via `IBuildEngine.Yield`, or this can implicitly happen when MSBuild discovers dependencies on tasks that have not run yet)
+
+Once a `project instance` is assigned to a worker node - it is locked to that node (and cannot be run on another one). Above 2 facts can lead to scheduling issues (priorities inversions, blocking).
+
+Scheduler can (opt-in) dump a graph of dependencies from last build into a text file and then use it in the next build (with option of [various scheduling algorithms](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/7cfb36cb90d1c9cc34bc4e0910d0c9ef42ee47b6/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Scheduler/Scheduler.cs#L833))
+
+Another mode of building is `graph build` - where project is build only once all its dependencies are resolved (so the build graph needs to be known and unchanged upfront).
