 "Two projects should not share their OutputPath nor IntermediateOutputPath locations"
 
-It is not recommended to share output path nor intermediate output path between multiple projects. Such practice can lead to silent overwrites of the outputs. Such overwrites will depepend on the order of the build, that might not be guaranteed (if not explicitly configured) and hence it can cause nondeterministic behavior of the build.

 "Two tasks should not write the same file"
 
-This is a similar problem as ['BC0101 - Shared output path'](#BC0101) - however with higher granularity. It is not recomended that multiple tasks attempts to write to a single file - as such behavior might lead to nondeterminism of a build (as result can be dependant on the order of the tasks execution if those belong to independent projects) or/and to a lost updates.

 If you want multiple tasks to update file in a one-by-one pipeline fashion, it is recommended to give each intermediate output a distinct name - preventing silent mixups if any of the tasks in the chain are skipped or removed.
