+# MSBuild's reserved and built-in properties
+
+The MSBuild engine itself sets some properties for all projects. There is normal documentation for the [reserved properties and their meanings](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-reserved-and-well-known-properties). This document describes the implementation of these properties in MSBuild itself.
+
+There are actually two different implementations of this functionality in MSBuild.
+
+## Built-in properties
+
+When evaluating an individual project, Pass 0 of the evaluation calls [`AddBuiltInProperties()`][addbuiltinproperties] which in turn calls [`SetBuiltInProperty()`][setbuiltinproperty] which sets the property basically as normal.
+
+However, properties set there are not available at all parts of execution, and specifically they're not available when evaluating the `.tasks` file that makes MSBuild's built-in tasks available by default to all projects.
+
+## Reserved properties
+
+Reserved properties are [set by the toolset][toolset_reservedproperties] and are available _only_ in the `.tasks` and `.overridetasks` cases. Properties set there are not available in normal project evaluation.
