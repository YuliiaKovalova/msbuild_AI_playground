 # Summary
 
-Project cache is a new assembly-based plugin extension point in MSBuild which determines whether a build request (a project) can be skipped during build. The main expected benefit is reduced build times via [caching and/or distribution](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/specs/static-graph.md#weakness-of-the-old-model-caching-and-distributability).

 # Motivation
 
-As the introduction to [static graph](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/specs/static-graph.md#what-is-static-graph-for) suggests, large and complex repos expose the weaknesses in MSBuild's scheduling and incrementality models as build times elongate. This project cache plugin lets MSBuild natively communicate with existing tools that enable build caching and/or distribution, enabling true scalability.

This project cache plugin lets MSBuild natively communicate with existing tools that enable build caching and/or distribution, enabling true scalability.
 
 Visual Studio is one beneficiary. This plugin inverts dependencies among build systems: instead of higher level build engines ([Cloudbuild](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/cloudbuild-microsofts-distributed-and-caching-build-service/), [Anybuild](https://github.com/AnyBuild/AnyBuild), [BuildXL](https://github.com/microsoft/BuildXL), etc) calling into MSBuild, MSBuild calls into them, keeping MSBuild's external APIs and command line arguments largely unchanged and thus reusable by Visual Studio.

   - On cache hits, MSBuild skips the project, but needs a BuildResult with target results to send back to the [Scheduler](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/d39f2e4f5f3d461bc456f9abed9adec4a2f0f542/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Scheduler/Scheduler.cs#L25).
   - Plugins have three options:
     - Worst: plugins fake the build results for each target. We consider this brittle since the plugins will have to be updated whenever the build logic changes.
-    - Better: plugins tell MSBuild to run a proxy target as a replacement for the expensive target (e.g. it tells MSBuild to run `GetTargetPath` and use those results for the Build target). See the [ProjectReference protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/ProjectReference-Protocol.md) for more details.

   - Absolute paths will likely break the build, since they'd be captured on the machine that writes to the cache.
 - Slow connections. In a coffee shop it might be faster to build everything instead of downloading from the cache. Consider racing plugin checks and building: if the bottom up build traversal reaches a node that's still querying the cache, cancel the cache query and build the node instead.
 - Inferring what targets to run on each node when using /graph
-  - Msbuild /graph requires that the [target inference protocol](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/documentation/specs/static-graph.md#inferring-which-targets-to-run-for-a-project-within-the-graph) is good enough.

-The cache files contain the serialized state of MSBuild's [ConfigCache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCache.cs) and [ResultsCache](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCache.cs). These two caches have been traditionally used by the engine to cache build results. For example, it is these caches which ensure that a target is only built once per build submission.

 <!-- How input / output cache entries are separated with the override caches -->
-Entries that make it into the output cache file are separated from entries serialized from input cache files via the use of [ConfigCacheWithOverride](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCacheWithOverride.cs) and [ResultsCacheWithOverride](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCacheWithOverride.cs). These are composite caches. Each contains two underlying caches: a cache where input caches files are loaded into (called the override cache), and a cache where new results are written into (called the current cache). Cache reads are satisified from both underlying caches (override cache is queried first, current cache is queried second). Writes are only written to the current cache, never into the override cache. The output cache file only contains the serialized current cache, and not the override cache, thus ensuring that only newly built results are serialized in the output cache file. It is illegal for both the current cache and override cache to contain entries for the same project configuration, a constraint that is checked by the two override caches on each cache read.

 # Task dependency resolution
 ## Problem definition
-Tasks with complex and specifically platform specific dependencies don't work out of the box. For example if a task uses [`LibGit2Sharp`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibGit2Sharp) package it will not work as is. `LibGit2Sharp` has native dependencies which are platform specific. While the package carries all of them, there's no built in support for the task to load the right ones. For example [source link](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/blob/master/src/Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Git/GitLoaderContext.cs) runs into this problem.

 ## Solution
 .NET Core uses `.deps.json` files to describe dependencies of components. It would be natural to treat task assemblies as components and use associated .deps.json file to determine their dependencies. This would make the system work nicely end to end with the .NET Core CLI/SDK and VS integration.
