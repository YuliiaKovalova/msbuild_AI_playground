+### Implementation details

+- `OpenTelemetryManager` - singleton that manages lifetime of OpenTelemetry objects listening to `Activity`ies, start by initializing in `Xmake` or `BuildManager`.
+- Task and Target data is forwarded from worker nodes via `TelemetryForwarder` and `InternalTelemetryForwardingLogger` and then aggregated to stats and serialized in `TelemetryDataUtils` and attached to the default `vs/msbuild/build` event.
 
-## Uncertainties
+## Future work when/if we decide to invest in telemetry again
 
-- Configuring tail sampling in VS telemetry server side infrastructure.
-- Sampling rare events details.
-- In standalone we could start the collector async without waiting which would potentially miss some earlier traces (unlikely to miss the important end of build trace though) but would degrade performance less than waiting for it's startup. The performance and utility tradeoff is not clear.
-- Can collector startup/shutdown be faster?
-- Exceptions in Collector code paths
-- Do we want to send antivirus state? Figuring it out is expensive: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/main...proto/get-av ~100ms
-- ability to configure the overall and per-namespace sampling from server side (e.g. storing it in the .msbuild folder in user profile if different then default values set from server side - this would obviously have a delay of the default sample rate # of executions)
+- avoid initializing/finalizing collector in VS when there is one running
+- multiple levels of sampling for different types of events
+- running by default with head sampling (simplifies instrumentation with `Activity`ies)
+- implement anonymization consistently in an OTel processor and not ad hoc in each usage
+- add datapoints helping perf optimization decisions/ reliability investigations
