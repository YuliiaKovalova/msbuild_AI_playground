+# Packages Sourcing
+
+The feature is meant to simplify the process of fixing, testing and contributing changes in projects published as nugets.
+
+It is inspired by the golang modules functioning - where a standalone dependency has a pointer to it's source location as a first-class citizen within the ecosystem (go.mod) and the relation between the source code and runtime dependecy is unambigously guaranteed by the compiler.
+
+The feature is envisioned to be facilitated via [`SourceLink`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink) repository metadata, [`PE headers`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.portableexecutable.peheaders?view=net-7.0) metadata, in-memory switching between `PackageReference` and `ProjectReference` and possibly verification of proper outputs (for `deterministic build` enabled projects).
+
+# User scenarios
+
+## OSS package reference
+* Alice is referencing FooBar nuget in her project and she is using automated PRs to consume the latest available version
+* A new version of FooBar nuget is published, automated PR into Alice project is created to update the `PackageReference` and the PR is failing
+* Alice is investigating the issue and suspecting problem in FooBar library. If the package was properly SourceLink-ed and symbols published, Alice can debug into the code and diagnose the issue
+* Alice would like to try to fix the issue, test the fix and contribute back to the OSS. She can achieve this with `Packages Sourcing` feature
+
+## Internal corp package flows
+* Bob is working in Contoso co. Contoso co. has dozens of internal repositories and internal package feed used to publish and consume the artifacts of individual repositories
+* Bob is working on component that is consuming another component - BarBaz - as a nuget package.
+* Bob wants to contribute an improvement to component BarBaz, that would be leveraged by his component. He wants to first test the improvement with his component before contributing back to the BarBaz. He can achieve this with `Packages Sourcing` feature
+
+## (Out of scope) Source as package reference
+* Bob from previous scenario needs to work on couple of components that interact with each other and which reference themselves via `PackageReference`s.
+* To simplify his work, Bob wants to include locations with components source code as reference locations for resolving `PackageReference`s, while he'd expect the build to properly interpret the components sources as packages (provided those can be successfuly build and packed)
+* Alteration of this sceanrio is referencing a reference via git repo link and commit hash (analogously to go modules).
+
+# Scope
+
+## In scope
+* API for initiating the `Package Sourcing` for particular nuget (sdk?). API for flipping the `PackageReference` (msbuild?)
+* Flip to interactive reference and patching should survive between builds on a single machine 
+
+## Out of scope
+ * **Patching the package/binary dependencies in a deployable way**. The interaction is ment to be used only on developer machine and not survive beyond repository push, external environment deployment etc.
+ * **Survival of patches accross `PackageReference` updates**.
+ * **Supporting nuget packages that are not `SourceLink` enabled**. As a fallback we might use `SourceLink` stamped symbols, but unless the `SourceLink` information is to be found either within the nuget package or published matching symbols, this feature will not be enabled.
+ * **Custom pre-build prerequisities**. First version of the feature will assume existence of the project file with matching name (or `AssemblyName`) within the linked repository and it's possibility to build with `dotnet build`.

+![control flow proposal](packagessourcing-control-flow.jpg)
+
+ ## Subproblems
+
+ * Opting-in mechanism - to request switch to local sources
+ * Preserving the info about swtich to local sources
+ * Opting-out mechanism - to switch back to regular package reference
+ * Indication mechanism informing the user about usage of local sources (especially in case where local patch is applied)
+ * Locating and fetching proper source codes
+ * Infering the proper 'build recipe' for the binary and verifying the result (in case of determinictic build)
+ * Verifying that the locally build package is correct - leveraging deterministic build; signature stripping etc.
+ * Allowing to quickly consume local code patches (via edit and continue/ hot reload mechanism)
+
+ Some of those problems might be eliminated by simplifying the workflow and e.g. providing a command that prepares a project and edits the original MSBuild file to replace `PackageReference` with `ProjectReference` - the consuming of code patches and indicating the altered reference to user would not be needed.
+ 
+ ## Possible Implementations
+
+ ### Locating proper sources
+ * Most preferable way is via `SourceLink` metadata within the nuget package itself ([documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink), [reading the metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-client-sdk#get-package-metadata))
+ * Fallback to `SourceLink` metadata within symbol files ([documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/sourcelink?view=msvc-170), [Portable PDB format spec](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/specs/PortablePdb-Metadata.md), [reading source locations metadata](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Reflection.Metadata/tests/Metadata/PortablePdb/DocumentNameTests.cs))
+ * We should consider ability to specify/pass-in a custom location of sources - this would facilitate portion of the 'Source as package reference' scenario (possibly something that might be usable for our 'source build' or 'VMR build').
+
+ ### Infering the 'build recipe'
+ This is the most challenging part of the story - as .NET ecosystem currently doesn't enforce custom build pre-requisities standards nor conventions and hence it is not possible to replicate the package build process without possible manual steps. This part will hence be 'best efforts' with sensible communication of issues to user.
+ * Option A: Sources crawling and finding project by name/assembly name; build; compare results
+ * Option B: Working backwards from the nuget (finding pack script or msbuild properties indicating nuget creation ...); build; compare results
+ * Option C: Using Roslyn to extract information from PE and reconstruct the compilation ([experimental code](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Compilers/Core/Rebuild/CompilationFactory.cs#L45))
+
+**_Extensive research needed for this subproblem._**
+
+ ### Verifying identity of local package with the feed one
+
+ In case deterministic build was opted-out, this would be very challenging and nearly impossible - so not supported.
+ For signed assemblies we'll need to strip signatures ([`ImageRemoveCertificate`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/imagehlp/nf-imagehlp-imageremovecertificate)). Removing signature might nullify checksum bytes in PE header - so binary comparison to the locally built assembly might not match (solution is to temporarily remove the PE header checksum from the local binary as well - to facilitate binary equality).
