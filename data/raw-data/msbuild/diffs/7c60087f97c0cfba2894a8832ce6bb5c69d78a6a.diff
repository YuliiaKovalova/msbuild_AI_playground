 See the [public documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/app-domains/gac). The GAC is a folder where different installations of VS on the same machine look for assemblies that are commonly used. If an assembly is in the GAC, it will be prioritized over any other assembly.

 ## What MSBuild Assemblies are installed on my Machine?
 Run the [EnumerateMSBuild powershell script](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/scripts/EnumerateMSBuild.ps1) from our repo. It will output a `msbuild_versions.txt` file that lists MSBuild assemblies in their common folders along with their versions.

 ## Other assemblies
-We have an issue [tracking other assemblies](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/5955) that can cause problems when in the GAC. If one of these assemblies is causing issues for you, refer to [How to Remove MSBuild Assemblies from the GAC](#how-to-remove-msbuild-assemblies-from-the-gac) while changing the assembly name and version.
