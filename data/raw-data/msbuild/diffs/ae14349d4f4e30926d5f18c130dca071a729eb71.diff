 ## At release time
-
+Before starting the process:
 - [ ] If the release is being cut more than a few days before the VS-side snap, do these two steps. Otherwise check them off.
   - [ ]  Modify the VS insertion so that it flows from MSBuild `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` to VS `main` [in the MSBuild-release-branch release definition](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_release?definitionId=1319&view=mine&_a=releases). Alternatively, if the release being cut no more than couple of weeks, disable the scheduled releases and create releases from `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` manually until the VS-side snap: Edit -> Schedule set under Artifacts -> disable toggle
 AND
   - [ ]  Disable automated run of [the MSBuild-main-branch release definition](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_release?definitionId=2153&view=mine&_a=releases) (because our {{NEXT_VERSION}} builds don't have a place to go in VS yet)

+### Branching from main
+- [ ]  If the new version's branch was created before the Visual Studio fork: fast-forward merge the correct commit (the one that is currently inserted to VS main) to the `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` branch \
+e.g.: `git push upstream 2e6f2ff7ea311214255b6b2ca5cc0554fba1b345:refs/heads/vs17.10` \
+_(This is for the case where we create the branch too early and want it to be based actually on a different commit. If you waited until a good point in time with `main` in a clean state, just branch off and you are done. The branch should point to a good, recent spot, so the final-branding PR goes in on top of the right set of commits.)_
+- [ ]  Update the branch merge flow in `.config/git-merge-flow-config.jsonc` file to have the currently-in-servicing branches.
+- [ ]  Create {{NEXT_VERSION}} branding PR (in main) including public API baseline package version change: {{URL_OF_NEXT_VERSION_BRANDING_PR}}. 
+  - In the file `eng/Versions.props` Update the `VersionPrefix` to `{{NEXT_VERSION}}` and `PackageValidationBaselineVersion` set to a latest internally available {{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}} preview version in the [internal dnceng dotnet-tools feed](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_artifacts/feed/dotnet-tools-internal).

+### Adjust pipelines / releases
 - [ ]  Fix OptProf data flow for the new vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}} branch
   - [ ] Run the [official build](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=9434) for vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}} without OptProf (set `SkipApplyOptimizationData` variable in 'Advanced options' section of the 'Run pipeline' menu to `true`) or alternatively with the latest Opt-Prof collected for the main branch (set `Optional OptProfDrop Override` to the drop path of the collected data, which could be found in the logs of the pipeline: Windows_NT -> Build -> search for `OptimizationData`). 
   - [ ] Check that the [OptProf data collection](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=17389) pipeline run is triggered for vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}. If not, run manually ('Run pipeline' in upper right)
   - [ ] Run the [official build](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=9434) for vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}} with no extra customization - OptProf should succeed now
