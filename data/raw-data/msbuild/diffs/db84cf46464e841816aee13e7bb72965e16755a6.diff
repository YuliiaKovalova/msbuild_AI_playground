 ## At release time
 Before starting the process:
-- [ ] If the release is being cut more than a few days before the VS-side snap, do these two steps. Otherwise check them off.
-  - [ ]  Modify the VS insertion so that it flows from MSBuild `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` to VS `main` [in the MSBuild-release-branch release definition](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_release?definitionId=1319&view=mine&_a=releases). Alternatively, if the release being cut no more than couple of weeks, disable the scheduled releases and create releases from `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` manually until the VS-side snap: Edit -> Schedule set under Artifacts -> disable toggle
-AND
-  - [ ]  Disable automated run of [the MSBuild-main-branch release definition](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_release?definitionId=2153&view=mine&_a=releases) (because our {{NEXT_VERSION}} builds don't have a place to go in VS yet)
+- [ ] If the release is being cut more than a few days before the VS-side snap, run insertions manually OR redirect MSBuild release branch 
+  - [ ]  Disabling automated run of [MSBuild VS Insertion pipeline](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=24295) (our {{NEXT_VERSION}} builds don't have a place to go in VS yet) is done by: Edit -> ... -> Triggers -> add a schedule on a dead branch (this overrides the YAML defined once-per-day schedule). In manual pipeline run you select MSBuild branch `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` and VS TargetBranch `main`.
+OR
+  - [ ]  If the release is being cut more than couple of weeks modify YAML (and merge to affected MSBuild branches) of the [VS insertion pipeline](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=24295) so that it flows from MSBuild `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` to VS `main` [in the MSBuild VS Insertion pipeline](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=24295) and keep scheduled insertions to simplify your workflow.
 
 ### Branching from main
 - [ ]  If the new version's branch was created before the Visual Studio fork: fast-forward merge the correct commit (the one that is currently inserted to VS main) to the `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` branch \
