+# Deploying Just-Built MSBuild
+
+## Visual Studio
+
+[Deploy-MSBuild](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/deploy-msbuild/scripts/Deploy-MSBuild.ps1) is a way to conveniently take private bits and install them into Visual Studio (VS) for testing. To use it:
+
+- If you haven't already, clone [MSBuild](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild) and make the changes you want.
+- Build MSBuild with the changes you want using `build.cmd /p:CreateBootstrap=true`.
+- In an administrator powershell window, navigate to the msbuild folder.
+- Run `scripts\Deploy-MSBuild.ps1 -destination {destination} -configuration {configuration}`.
+  - Specify the Bin folder of MSBuild in your VS install as the destination. This is somewhere like `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin"`.
+  - Make sure the `{configuration}` you pass to the deploy script matches the one you gave to `build.cmd` (this is `Debug` by default).
+
+The Deploy-MSBuild script creates backups of the relevant MSBuild binaries, then copies the new binaries in their place.
+
+⚠ CAUTION: If you overwrite the MSBuild in Visual Studio you can break Visual Studio. That in turn can prevent you from building MSBuild to fix your bug! The deploy script makes backups by default which you may need to manually copy back over.
+
+### Crossing machines
+
+If you cannot build or cannot deploy MSBuild on the same machine on which you wish to use the updated version of VS, build and deploy to an empty folder instead. Then, manually make a backup of the files in that folder and overwrite them in the VS install of choice.
+
+## .NET (Core) SDK
+
+Deploy-MSBuild can also patch a .NET (Core) SDK installation. Pass the `-runtime Core` argument to `Deploy-MSBuild.ps1` to ensure that it selects .NET Core MSBuild.

-# Static Graph
+## What is static graph for?
+
+As a repo gets bigger and more complex, weaknesses in MSBuild's scheduling and incrementality models become more apparent. MSBuild's static graph features are intended to ameliorate these weaknesses while remaining as compatible as possible with existing projects and SDKs.
+
+MSBuild projects can refer to other projects by using the `MSBuild` task to execute targets in another project and return values. In `Microsoft.Common.targets`, `ProjectReference` items are transformed into `MSBuild` task executions in order to provide a user-friendly interface: "reference the output of these projects".
+
+### Weakness of the old model: project-level scheduling
+
+Because references to other projects aren't known until a target in the referencing project calls the `MSBuild` task, the MSBuild engine cannot start working on building referenced projects until the referencing project yields. For example, if project `A` depended on `B`, `C`, and `D` and was being built with more-than-3 way parallelism, an ideal build would run `B`, `C`, and `D` in parallel with the parts of `A` that could execute before the references were available.
+
+Today, the order of operations of this build are:
+
+1. `A` completes evaluation and starts building, doing isolated work until it gets to `ResolveProjectReferences`.
+1. In parallel, `B`, `C`, and `D` run the requested targets.
+1. `A` resumes building and completes.
+
+With graph-aware scheduling, this becomes:
+
+1. `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` evaluate in parallel.
+1. `B`, `C`, and `D` build to completion in parallel.
+1. `A` builds, and instantly gets cached results for the `MSBuild` task calls in `ResolveProjectReferences`
+
+### Weakness of the old model: incrementality
+
+[Incremental build](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/incremental-builds) (that is, "redo only the parts of the build that would produce different outputs compared to the last build") is the most powerful tool to reduce build times and increase developer inner-loop speed.
+
+MSBuild supports incremental builds by allowing a target to be skipped if the target's outputs are up to date with its inputs. This allows tools like the compiler to be skipped when possible. But since the incrementality is at the target level, MSBuild must fully evaluate the project and walk through all targets, running those that are out of date or that don't specify inputs and outputs.
+
+Consider a simple solution with a library and an application that depends on the library. Suppose you build, then make a change in the application's source code, then build again.
+
+The second build will:
+
+1. Build the library project, skipping all targets that define inputs and outputs.
+1. Build the application project.
+
+But using higher-level knowledge, we can see a more-optimal build:
+
+1. Skip everything involving the library project, because _none_ of its inputs have changed.
+1. Build only the application project.
+
+Visual Studio offers a ["fast up-to-date check"](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/cd275918ef9f181f6efab96715a91db7aabec832/docs/up-to-date-check.md) system that gets closer to the latter, but MSBuild itself does not.
+
+### Weakness of the old model: caching and distributability
+
+For very large builds, including many Microsoft products, the fact that MSBuild can build in parallel only on a single machine is a major impediment, even if incrementality is addressed.
+
+Ideally, a build could span multiple computers, and each could use results generated on another machine as inputs to its own build projects. In addition, if all of a project's inputs remain unchanged, the system would ideally reuse the outputs of the project, even if they were built long ago on another computer.
+
+Microsoft has an internal build system, [CloudBuild](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/cloudbuild-microsofts-distributed-and-caching-build-service/), that supports this and has proven that it is effective, but is heuristic-based and requires maintenance.
+
+MSBuild static graph features make it easier to implement a system like CloudBuild by building operations like graph construction and output caching into MSBuild itself.
+
+## What is static graph?
+
+MSBuild's static graph extends the MSBuild engine and APIs with new functionality to improve on these weaknesses:
+
+- The ability to [construct a directed acyclic graph of MSBuild projects](#project-graph) given an entry point (solution or project).
+- The ability to consider that graph when scheduling projects for build.
+- The ability to cache MSBuild's internal build results (metadata about outputs, not the outputs themselves) across build invocations.
+- The ability to [enforce restrictions on builds](#isolated-builds) to ensure that the graph is correct and complete.
+
+Static graph functionality can be used in three ways:
+
+- On the command line with `-graph` (and equivalent API).
+  - This gets the scheduling improvements for well-specified projects, but allows underspecified projects to complete without error.
+- On the command line with `-graph -isolate` (and equivalent API).
+  - This gets the scheduling improvements and also enforces that the graph is correct and complete. In this mode, MSBuild will produce an error if there is an `MSBuild` task invocation that was not known to the graph ahead of time.
+- As part of a higher-order build system that uses [single project isolated builds](#single-project-isolated-builds) to provide caching and/or distribution on top of the built-in functionality. The only known implementation of this system is Microsoft-internal currently.
+
+"Correct and complete" here means that the static graph can be used to accurately predict all targets that need to be built for all projects in the graph, and all of the references between projects. This is required for the higher-order build system scenario, because an unknown reference couldn't be satisfied at runtime (as it is in regular MSBuild and `-graph` with no `-isolate` scenarios).
 
-## Overview
+## Design documentation
+
+### Design goals
 
-### Motivations
 - Stock projects can build with "project-level build" and if clean onboard to MS internal build engines with cache/distribution
 - Stock projects will be "project-level build" clean.
 - Add determinism to MSBuild w.r.t. project dependencies. Today MSBuild discovers projects just in time, as it finds MSBuild tasks. This means there’s no guarantee that the same graph is produced two executions in a row, other than hopefully sane project files. With the static graph, you’d know the shape of the build graph before the build starts.

 - Node edges
   - When project A references multitargeting project B, and B is identified as an outer build, the graph node for project A will reference both the outer build of B, and all the inner builds of B. The edges to the inner builds are speculative, as at build time only one inner build gets referenced. However, the graph cannot know at evaluation time which inner build will get chosen.
   - When multitargeting project B is a root, then the outer build node for B will reference the inner builds of B.

 Similarly for a theoretical server mode for MSBuild, MSBuild would need to report its own I/O rather than the higher-order build engine detouring the process externally. For example, if the higher-order build engine connected to an existing running MSBuild process to make build requests, it could not detour that process and so MSBuild would need to report all I/O done as part of a particular build request.
 
 **OPEN ISSUE:** As described above in an open issue, tool servers are the only scenario which would not be supportable by just externally detouring the MSBuild process. The amount of investment required to enable tool servers is quite high and spans across multiple codebases: MSBuild needs to detour itself, MSBuild need to expose a new Tasks API, the `Csc` task needs to opt into that API, and the higher-order build engine needs to opt-in to MSBuild reporting its own I/O, as well as detecting that the feature is supported in the version of MSBuild it's using. Tool servers may add substantial performance gain, but the investment is also substantial.

+# What are Change Waves?
+A Change Wave is a set of risky features developed under the same opt-out flag. The purpose of this is to warn developers of risky changes that will become standard functionality down the line. If there's something we think is worth the risk, we found that Change Waves were a good middle ground between making necessary changes and warning customers of what will soon be permanent.
+
+## Why Opt-Out vs. Opt-In?
+Opt-out is a better approach for us because we'd likely get limited feedback when a feature impacts customer builds. When a feature does impact a customer negatively, it's a quick switch to disable and allows time to adapt. The key aspect to Change Waves is that it smooths the transition for customers adapting to risky changes that the MSBuild team feels strongly enough to take.
+
+## How do They Work?
+The opt-out comes in the form of setting the environment variable `MSBuildDisableFeaturesFromVersion` to the Change Wave (or version) that contains the feature you want **disabled**. This version happens to be the version of MSBuild that the features were developed for. See the mapping of change waves to features below.
+
+## Choosing a Change Wave for a New Feature
+This is determined on a case by case basis and should be discussed with the MSBuild team. A safe bet would be to check our [currently active Change Waves](ChangeWaves.md#change-waves-&-associated-features) and pick the version after the latest MSBuild version. This version corresponds to the latest version of Visual Studio.
+
+# Developing With Change Waves in Mind
+For the purpose of providing an example, the rest of this document assumes we're developing a feature for MSBuild version **17.4**.
+
+The Process:
+1. Develop your feature.
+2. [Create the Change Wave](#creating-a-change-wave) (if necessary)
+3. [Condition your feature on that Change Wave](#condition-your-feature-on-a-change-wave)
+4. [Test your feature](#test-your-feature)
+5. [Document it](ChangeWaves.md#change-wave-features)
+6. [Delete the wave as it cycles out](#change-wave-'end-of-lifespan'-procedure)
+
+## Creating a Change Wave
+1. In the `Microsoft.Build` project, open `SharedUtilities\ChangeWaves.cs`.
+2. Add a const string to identify the new wave, following the format:
+```c#
+public const string Wave17_4 = "17.4";
+```
+3. You may need to delete the lowest wave as new waves get added.
+4. Update the AllWaves array appropriately.
+```c#
+public static readonly string[] AllWaves = { Wave16_10, Wave17_0, Wave17_4 };
+```
+
+## Condition Your Feature On A Change Wave
+Surround your feature with the following:
+```c#
+    // If you pass an incorrectly formatted change wave, this will throw.
+    // Use the const Version that was created in the previous step.
+    if (ChangeWaves.AreFeaturesEnabled(ChangeWaves.Wave17_4))
+    {
+        <your feature>
+    }
+```
+
+If you need to condition a Task or Target, use the built in `AreFeaturesEnabled` function.
+```xml
+<Target Name="SomeRiskyChange" Condition="$([MSBuild]::AreFeaturesEnabled('17.4'))"">
+<!-- Where '17.4' is the change wave assigned to your feature. -->
+```
+
+## Test Your Feature
+Create tests as you normally would. Include one test with environment variable `MSBuildDisableFeaturesFromVersion` set to `ChangeWaves.Wave17_4`. Set this like so:
+```c#
+TestEnvironment env = TestEnvironment.Create()
+
+env.SetChangeWave(ChangeWaves.Wave17_4);
+```
+When the TestEnvironment is disposed, it handles special logic to properly reset Change Waves for future tests.
+
+**Important!** If you need to build a project to test your feature (say, for tasks or targets), build via `ProjectCollection` in your test.
+
+Example:
+```c#
+using (TestEnvironment env = TestEnvironment.Create())
+{
+    // Important: use the constant here
+    env.SetChangeWave(ChangeWaves.Wave17_4);
+
+    string projectFile = @"
+        <Project>
+            <Target Name='HelloWorld' Condition=""$([MSBuild]::AreFeaturesEnabled('17.4'))"">
+                <Message Text='Hello World!'/>
+            </Target>
+        </Project>";
+
+    TransientTestFile file = env.CreateFile("proj.csproj", projectFile);
+
+    ProjectCollection collection = new ProjectCollection();
+    MockLogger log = new MockLogger();
+    collection.RegisterLogger(log);
+
+    collection.LoadProject(file.Path).Build().ShouldBeTrue();
+    log.AssertLogContains("Hello World!");
+}
+```
+
+## Change Wave 'End-of-Lifespan' Procedure
+These features will eventually become standard functionality. When a change wave rotates out, do the following:
+1. Start by deleting the constant `Wave17_4` that was created in [Creating a Change Wave](#creating-a-change-wave).
+2. Remove `ChangeWave.AreFeaturesEnabled` or `[MSBuild]::AreFeaturesEnabled` conditions surrounding features that were assigned that change wave.
+3. Remove tests associated with ensuring features would not run if this wave were set.
+4. Clear all other issues that arose from deleting the constant.

       We give this treatment to .vcxproj by default since no .vcxproj can target more
-      than one framework.
+      than one framework currently. The user must specify exactly one TargetFramework.
+
+      vcxproj files compile down to OS-specific binaries, either native or .NET. In the
+      _GetProjectReferenceTargetFrameworkProperties target of Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets,
+      SkipTargetFrameworkProperties is set to true for vcxproj to account for that.
+
+      This means we do not fill the Item _ProjectReferenceTargetFrameworkPossibilities or, by extension,
+      the AnnotatedProjects Item.
+
+      For single-targeted projects, we normally decorate the AnnotatedProjects Item with
+      UndefineProperties metadata specifying that TargetFramework should be undefined. Because it
+      isn't defined properly at that stage, however, this does not happen, and TargetFramework is
+      defined at this point in addition to having been defined globally. Currently, this is always
+      true for vcxproj.
+
+      MSBuild permits building the same project twice as long as it has different sets of global properties.
+      Because the TargetFramework global property is not being removed as expected by the multitargeting
+      part of MSBuild, the engine recognizes that there are differences and builds it twice. This can
+      become more noticeable if the projects build in parallel, since they could try to access the same
+      resources and conflict, failing the build. Note, however, that building the same project twice in
+      this way is always wrong even if it seems minor because they do not conflict, and the second build is
+      relatively fast.
