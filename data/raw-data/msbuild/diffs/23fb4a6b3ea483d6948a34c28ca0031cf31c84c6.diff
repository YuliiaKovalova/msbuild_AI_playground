 # MSBuild Server
 
-MSBuild Server is basically an another type of node which can accept build request from clients and utilize worker nodes in current fashion to build projects. Main purpose of the server node is to avoid expensive MSBuild process start during build from tools like .NET SDK.
+MSBuild Server nodes accept build requests from clients and use worker nodes in the current fashion to build projects. The main purpose of the server node is to preserve caches between builds and avoid expensive MSBuild process start operations during build from tools like the .NET SDK.
+
+## Usage
+
+The primary ways to use MSBuild are via Visual Studio and via the CLI using the `dotnet build`/`dotnet msbuild` commands. MSBuild Server is not supported in Visual Studio because Visual Studio itself works like MSBuild Server. For the CLI, the server functionality is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the `DOTNET_CLI_DO_NOT_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER` environment variable to value `1`.
+To re-enable MSBuild Server, remove the variable or set its value to `0`.
