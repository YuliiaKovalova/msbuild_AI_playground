 ## Input / Output cache implementation
 <!-- cache structure -->
-The cache files contain the serialized state of MSBuild's [ConfigCache](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCache.cs) and [ResultsCache](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCache.cs). These two caches have been traditionally used by the engine to cache build results. For example, it is these caches which ensure that a target is only built once per build submission. The `ConfigCache` entries are instances of [BuildRequestConfiguration](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/BuildRequestConfiguration.cs#L25). The `ResultsCache` entries are instances of [BuildResult](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/BuildResult.cs#L34), which contain or more instances of [TargetResult](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Shared/TargetResult.cs#L22).

 One can view the two caches as the following mapping: `(project path, global properties) -> results`. `(project path, global properties)` is represented by a `BuildRequestConfiguration`, and the results are represented by `BuildResult` and `TargetResult`.
 
 <!-- cache lifetime -->
-The input and output cache files have the same lifetime as the `ConfigCache` and the `ResultsCache`. The `ConfigCache` and the `ResultsCache` are owned by the [BuildManager](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/BuildManager/BuildManager.cs), and their lifetimes are one `BuildManager.BeginBuild` / `BuildManager.EndBuild` session. On commandline builds, since MSBuild.exe uses one BuildManager with one BeginBuild / EndBuild session, the cache lifetime is the same as the entire process lifetime. When other processes (e.g. Visual Studio's devenv.exe) perform msbuild builds via the `BuildManager` APIs, there can be multiple build sessions in the same process.

 The following constraints are enforced during cache aggregation:

 <!-- How input / output cache entries are separated with the override caches -->
-Entries that make it into the output cache file are separated from entries serialized from input cache files via the use of [ConfigCacheWithOverride](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ConfigCacheWithOverride.cs) and [ResultsCacheWithOverride](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/Caching/ResultsCacheWithOverride.cs). These are composite caches. Each contains two underlying caches: a cache where input caches files are loaded into (called the override cache), and a cache where new results are written into (called the current cache). Cache reads are satisified from both underlying caches (override cache is queried first, current cache is queried second). Writes are only written to the current cache, never into the override cache. The output cache file only contains the serialized current cache, and not the override cache, thus ensuring that only newly built results are serialized in the output cache file. It is illegal for both the current cache and override cache to contain entries for the same project configuration, a constraint that is checked by the two override caches on each cache read.

 ### How isolation exemption complicates everything
 <!-- Potential cache scenarios caused by exemption -->
 Project references [can be exempt](static-graph.md#exempting-references-from-isolation-constraints) from isolation constraints via the `GraphIsolationExemptReference` item.
 
-The `Scheduler` knows to skip isolation constraints on an exempt `BuildRequest` because the [ProjectBuilder compares](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L349) each new `BuildRequest` against the `GraphIsolationExemptReference` items defined in the calling project, and if exempt, sets `BuildRequest.SkipStaticGraphIsolationConstraints`. When a `BuildRequest` is marked as exempt, the `Scheduler` also marks its corresponding `BuildRequestConfiguration` as exempt as well, which aids in further identification of exempt projects outside the `Scheduler`.
+The `Scheduler` knows to skip isolation constraints on an exempt `BuildRequest` because the [ProjectBuilder compares](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/37c5a9fec416b403212a63f95f15b03dbd5e8b5d/src/Build/BackEnd/Components/RequestBuilder/RequestBuilder.cs#L349) each new `BuildRequest` against the `GraphIsolationExemptReference` items defined in the calling project, and if exempt, sets `BuildRequest.SkipStaticGraphIsolationConstraints`. When a `BuildRequest` is marked as exempt, the `Scheduler` also marks its corresponding `BuildRequestConfiguration` as exempt as well, which aids in further identification of exempt projects outside the `Scheduler`.
 
 The build results for the exempt project are also included in the current cache (according to the above mentioned rule that newly built results are serialized in the output cache file). This complicates the way caches interact in several scenarios:
 1. the same project can be exempt via multiple references, thus potentially colliding when multiple output cache files containing the same exempt project get aggregated. For example, given the graph `{A->B, A->C}`, where both `B` and `C` build the exempt project `D`, `D` will appear in the output caches of both `B` and `C`. When `A` aggregates these two caches, it will encounter duplicate entries for `D`, and will need to merge the results.

 [MSBuildStructuredLog](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/MSBuildStructuredLog) can be used to get a clearer idea of what's going on in your build. MSBuildStructuredLog is graphical interface over MSBuild binary logs that visualizes a structured representation of executed targets, tasks, properties, and item values. It can be easier to look though than the diagnostic log.
