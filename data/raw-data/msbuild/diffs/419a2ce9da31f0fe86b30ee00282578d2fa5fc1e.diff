 # Telemetry

+We want to implement telemetry collection for VS/MSBuild.exe scenarios where we are currently not collecting data. VS OpenTelemetry initiative provides a good opportunity to use their infrastructure and library. 
 There is some data we collect via SDK which we want to make accessible.
 
 ## Goals and Motivation 
 
-We have no data about usage of MSBuild customers in VS.
+We have limited data about usage of MSBuild by our customers in VS and no data about usage of standalone msbuild.exe.
 This limits us in prioritization of features and scenarios to optimize performance for. 
-Implementing telemetry via VS OpenTelemetry initiative would give us comprehensive insight into how MSBuild is used in all scenarios. 
+Over time we want to have comprehensive insight into how MSBuild is used in all scenarios. Collecting such a data without any constraints nor limitations would however be prohibitively expensive (from the data storage PoV and possibly as well from the client side performance impact PoV). Ability to sample / configure the collection is an important factor in deciding the instrumentation and collection tech stack. Implementing telemetry via VS OpenTelemetry initiative would give us this ability in the future.
 
 Goal: To have relevant data in that is actionable for decisions about development. Measuring real world performance impact of features (e.g. BuildCheck). Easily extensible telemetry infrastructure if we want to measure a new datapoint.

 - Performance regression risks - it's another thing MSBuild would do and if the perf hit would be too bad it would need mitigation effort.
 - It introduces a closed source dependency for VS and MSBuild.exe distribution methods which requires workarounds to remain compatible with SourceBuild policy (conditional compilation/build).
