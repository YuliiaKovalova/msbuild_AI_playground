 The document describes the logic behind the bootstrap and testing capabilities for the fresh MSBuild bits.
 
 ## History
-MSBuild is built for two different environments: .NET and .NET Framework. To check the changes for .NET, the fresh bits were published to the MSBuild.Bootstrap folder and copied to the bootstrap later together with a set of specific dependencies to make it work as a part of the .dotnet folder.
+MSBuild supports two different environments: .NET and .NET Framework. To test changes for .NET, fresh bits were published (the actual target Publish run) to the MSBuild.Bootstrap folder. These bits, along with specific dependencies, were later copied to the bootstrap, making them ready for use with dotnet.exe. The executable is part of the .dotnet folder.
 
 ## Current Implementation for .NET
-During the bootstrap phase, install-scripts is used for downloading the bits that are compatible with the current version. The logic of interplay with the scripts is moved to a separate MSBuild task: InstallDotNetCoreTask.cs. What happens under the hood:
+During the bootstrap phase, install-scripts are used to download the bits compatible with the current version. The logic for interacting with the scripts has been encapsulated in a separate MSBuild task: InstallDotNetCoreTask.cs. Hereâ€™s what happens under the hood:
 
- 1. The SDK is downloaded in the bootstrap folder.
- 2. Fresh MSBuild bits are copied to it later.
- 3. The constructed SDK is used for testing for both: local e2e tests and CI runs.

+
+## Potential Cons
+The reliance on downloading the SDK from a remote source requires an internet connection. For the initial build of the repository, this doesn't change as the SDK is always downloaded to the .dotnet folder first. However, for subsequent runs, the SDK will need to be downloaded again, which could be problematic in environments with limited or no internet connectivity.
+
+## Pros
+This approach simplifies testing MSBuild as part of dotnet by providing a ready and reliable environment without needing to patch anything into a globally installed SDK, as was previously required.
