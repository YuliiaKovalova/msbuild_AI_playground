-### The architecture
-
 If BuildCheck is enabled, then the events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource` and new events from BuildCheck are merged into an `IEventSource`, from witch the loggers get events.
     1. The events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource replayEventSource` are passed to the `IEventSource mergedEventSource` unchanged
     2. The events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource replayEventSource` are passed to `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler` in order to produce new events from BuildCheck
