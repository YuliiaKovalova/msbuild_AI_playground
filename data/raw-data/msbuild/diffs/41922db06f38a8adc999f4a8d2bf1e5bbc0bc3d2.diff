 Would there be any analyzers that are not possible to run during the replay mode (subject to internal design - this difference won't be exposed during [custom analyzers authoring](#custom-analyzers-authoring)), replay mode will inform user about those via warnings.
 
-Replay mode will by default consider `.editorconfig` files stored within the binlog and will run analyzers based on those. This may lead to unintended double-reports – as binlog will have the runtime analysis reports stored, plus the replay-time analysis reports will be augumented. At the same time we might want to run some additional checks in the replay mode, that have not been enabled (or not even available) during the build time.

 Initial version of BuildCheck plans a limited set of options configurable by user (via `.editorconfig`) by which users can override default configuration of individual analyzer rules.
