-# Decoupling VS builds of SDK projects
-*The objective of this one-pager is to provide clear and concise information about a feature or project to foster inclusion and collaboration by enabling anyone who is interested to learn the essential information, such as the project's goals, motivation, impact, and risks. The points and questions in each section are illustrative, they are not intended as a definite list of questions to be answered.*
-
-Ensure that all the logic from a build, from an SDK project comes from the SDK independently of where it is being built.
-
-## Description
- - Short summary of the feature or effort.
-
-## Goals and Motivation
- - What are we trying to achieve and why? 
-
-Consistency of end-user build experience
-Decoupling the SDK from VS
-Isolate the SDK builds to use only their components.
-
-Why:
-Experience of tooling authors
- - Roslyn analyzer authors
- - MSBuild Task authors
-
-experience of end users
- - Anyone who uses the analyzers or source egenrators
-
-Tooling authors need to target NetStandard2.0, or multi target and dependencies in multitargets is annoying. If you don't match the roslyn version for VS the analyzers and generators don't work.
-
-## Impact
-Multiple layer of impact:
- - Project construction
- - reduce cost of development for internal teams that contribute to Roslyn analyzers / source build generators and MSBuild Tasks.
-
- End users will not experience mismatch between analyzer versions. And they will be sure that the build will be the same as the command line invocation.
-
-## Stakeholders
-internal folks are the ones that will continue the work to fully complete the feature. 
- - VS Perf team: 
- - Project System team:
- - Roslyn team: Handover - once we're sending the environmental variable, they can enable the use of the core compiler in VS. The second handover is the same as the rest: you can write only .net code tasks and the sdk projects will build successfully.
-
-These are the folks that will benefit of these changes:
- - Analyzer / source generator author
- - MSBuild Task authors
-
-## Risks
- - There might be a performance hit on VS depending on how many non-framework tasks the project needs to load. As we can't do some pre-loading.
- - There should be no breaking from SDK only users. The IDE tooling might have a different version, which leads to discrepancy on partial builds.
- - We are early in the development effort, so if later there is a larger impact on perf or other issues, the effort in general might be delayed(?), but our part would already have been completed.
- - Deadline: no concrete deadline, but early in the preview cycle (preview 4-5) to get a sense of consequences of this change.
- - If we don't do this: Worse experience for devs that work in the area.
-
-## Cost
-1. Dev week's time
-2. Dev 1-2 months time.
-3. Dev 1 week if things do not go wrong at all.
-
-## Plan
- 1. Ensure that MSBuild.exe provides the same execution state as the dotnet command line invocation. MSExtensionPath (cant do that), DotNetHostPath, MSSDKsPath (cant do that).
-    -  Low effort, should be done first. 
- 2. Implement .NET core task host, so we can execute core version of tasks.
-    - Get Rainer feedback, seems like a medium sized.
- 3. Load common targets from the SDK and not .NetFramework (the VS version of it). This might be out of scope for .NET 10
-    - Medium effort, can have behavioral changes.

+# Decoupling VS builds of SDK projects
+The behaviour of an SDK project, when built in Visual Studio and when built in the DotNet CLI can vary, as different pieces of imports can be fetched from either build agent. This situation is not great specially for some developers as it increases their coding workload. To solve this, we want to ensure that all logic from a build from an *SDK project* comes from the SDK, independently of where the build is processed.
+
+## Goals and Motivation
+
+We are aiming for:
+ - Consistent end-user eperience for build in either DotNet CLI or Visual Studio.
+ - Isolating Dotnet SDK build to only their components.
+ - Decoupling the Dotnet SDK from VS.
+
+
+The reason we are persuing this is for a better experience when using or writting Roslyn analyzers and MSBuild Tasks. Currently tooling authors need to target NetStandard2.0 for their projects to be recognized by VS. Another options is to multi-target but it takes a lot more effort and time spent on that. Another aspect is the user experience, if the Roslyn version for VS analyzers and generators doesn't match the one in Visual Studio, they do not work.
+
+
+## Impact
+There are a few area of impact:
+ - SDK style project builds will be more stable between VS and CLI builds, as the tooling will not be devided between different versions.
+ - Reduced cost of development for external and internal teams that contribute to Roslyn Analyzers, SourceBuild generators, or MSBuild Tasks.
+ - End-user will not experience mismatch between analyzer versions, and confirmation that their SDK style builds will behave the same way in VS and in the command line.
+
+## Stakeholders
+For the internal stakeholder, we have the teams that will continue the work to fully complete the VS and SDK decoupling feature after our base work is done. There are two handovers in this project:
+
+1. Enabling the MSBuild.exe execution state to be the same as DotNet command line invocation so the Roslyn team can enable the use of their Core compiler in VS.
+2. Tasks and other projects can be written in .NET core and the SDK projects will build successuflly in VS. This enables other teams to migrate their tasks to .NET core instead of keeping them targeting .NET Framework.
+
+The handovers should allow other teams to proceed with their work smoothly and no change in build behaviour should be present within MSBuild.
+
+## Risks
+A few risks associated with this feature:
+ - There might be a performance hit on VS. It would depending on the amount of non-framwork tasks that the project will need to load when opening it in VS. The performance gain from pre-loading will not be available in this scenario.
+ - The VS tooling might present have a different version than the SDK installed, which might lead to discrepancy in partial builds.
+ - Our work is early in the development effort. If this feature is discovered to have too large of an impact in experience of performance the work might be delayed or discarded.
+ - There are no concrete deadlines for our part of the feature, but we are aiming for an early preview cycle, so we have a chance to measure the consequences and fix any issues that arise.
+
+## Plan
+ 1. Ensure that MSBuild.exe provides the same execution state as the dotnet command line invocation.
+    -  This is should take around 1 dev week to complete, and will be handed over to Roslyn team.
+ 2. Implement .NET core task host, tasks can be executed on the .NET Core vresion instead of .NET framework.
+    - This should take 1 to 2 dev months to complete, including extensive testing. This would be handed over to internal teams that have custom tasks so they can be updated and tested.
+ 3. Load common targets from the .NET SDK and not from .NET NetFramework on VS. This work depends on other team's finilizing their part of the feature and might not be in scope for .NET 10.
+    - This should take a dev week, if there are no major bugs or regressions.
