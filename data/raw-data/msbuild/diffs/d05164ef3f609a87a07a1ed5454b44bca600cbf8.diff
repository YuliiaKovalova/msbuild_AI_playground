+
+# Infrastructure and Execution
+
+## Data Source
+
+The major source of data for BuildCheck will be the `BuildEventArgs` data - as it is already well established diagnostic source for MSBuild builds.
+
+BuildCheck can source this data either offline from the binlog, or as a plugged logger during the live build execution. Choice was made to support both modes.
+
+The actual OM exposed to users will be translating/mapping/proxying the underlying MSBuild OM and hence the implementation details and actual extent of the data (whether internal or public) will be hidden.
+
+### Sourcing unexposed data from within execution
+
+For agility we'll be able to source internal data during the evaluation and/or execution directly from the build engine, without the `BuildEventArgs` exposure.
+One example of rich data that might be helpful for internal analyses is [`Project`](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/28f488a74ed75bf5f21ca93ac2463a8cb1586d79/src/Build/Definition/Project.cs#L49). This OM is not currently being used during the standard build execution (`ProjectInstance` is used instead) - but we can conditionaly create and expose `Project` and satisfy the current internal consumers of `ProjectInstance` - spike of that is available [in experimental branch](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/main...JanKrivanek:msbuild:research/analyzers-evaluation-hooking#diff-08a12a2fa138c3bfcabc7639bb75dda8534f3b662db4aca4f2b5595dbf9ba197).
+
+## Execution Modes
+
+**Replay Mode** - so that users can choose to perform analyses post build, without impacting the performance of the build. And so that some level of analysis can be run on artifacts from builds produced by older versions of MSBuild.
+
+**Live mode** - this is what users are used to from compilation analyses. Integrating into build execution will as well help driving adoption by opting-in users by default to some level of checking and hence exposing them to the feature.
+
+## Live Mode Hosting
+
+Prerequisites: [MSBuild Nodes Orchestration](../../wiki/Nodes-Orchestration.md#orchestration)
+
+The BuildCheck infrastructure will be prepared to be available concurrently within the `scheduler node` as well as in the additional `worker nodes`. There are 2 reasons for this:
+* BuildCheck will need to recognize custom analyzers packages during the evaluation time - so some basic code related to BuildCheck will need to be present in the worker node.
+* Presence in worker node (as part of the `RequestBuilder`), will allow inbox analyzers to agile leverage data not available within `BuildEventArgs` (while data proven to be useful should over time be exposed to `BuildEventArgs`)
+
+## Handling the Distributed Model
+
+We want to get some benefits (mostly inbox analyzers agility) from hosting BuildCheck infrastructure in worker nodes, but foremost we should prevent leaking the details of this model into public API and OM, until we are sure we cannot achieve all goals from just scheduler node from `BuildEventArgs` (which will likely never happen - as the build should be fully reconstructable from the `BuildEventArgs`).
+
+How we'll internally handle the distributed model:
+* Each node will have just a single instance of infrastructure (`IBuildCheckManager`) available (registered via the MSBuild dependency injection container - `IBuildComponentHost`). This applies to a scheduler node with inproc worker node as well.
+* Scheduler node will have an MSBuild `ILogger` registered that will enable communicating information from worker nodes BuildCheck module to the scheduler node BuildCheck module - namely:
+    * Acquisition module from worker node will be able to communicated to the scheduler node that it encountered `PackageReference` for particular analyzer and that it should be loaded and instantiated in the main node.
+    * Tracing module will be able to send perf stats from current worker node and aggregate all of those together in the main node.
+    * Theoretical execution-data-only sourcing inbox analyzer will be able to aggregate data from the whole build context (again - we should use this only for agility purposes, but shoot for analyzer that needs presence only in scheduler node). The way to do that can be via being present in all worker nodes, sending a specific type of 'in progress result' BuildEventArgs and aggreggating those intermediary results in the single instance running in the main node.
+* Apart from the scenarios above - the BuildCheck infrastructure modules in individual nodes should be able to function independently (namely - load the inbox analyzers that should live in nodes; send the analyzers reports via logging infrastructure; load user configuration from `.editorconfig` and decide on need to enable/disable/configure particular analyzers).
+* The custom analyzers will be hosted only in the main node - and hence the distributed model will be fully hidden from them. This might be a subject for revision in future versions.
+* Communication from main to worker node between BuildCheck infra modules is not planned (this might be revisited - even for the V1).
+
+## Analyzers Lifecycle
+
+Planned model:
+* Analyzers factories get registered with the BuildCheck infrastructure (`BuildCheckManager`)
+    * For inbox analyzers - this happens on startup.
+    * For custom analyzers - this happens on connecting `ILogger` instance in scheduler node receives acquistion event (`BuildCheckAcquisitionEventArgs`). This event is being sent by worker node as soon as it hits a special marker (a magic property function call) during early evaluation. Loading is not processed by worker node as currently we want custom analyzers only in the main node (as they will be only given data proxied from BuildEventArgs).
+    The `BuildCheckAcquisitionEventArgs` should be sent prior `ProjectEvaluationStartedEventArgs` (buffering will need to take place), or main node will need to replay some initial data after custom analyzer is registered.
+* `BuildCheckManager` receives info about new project starting to be build
+    * On scheduler node the information is sourced from `ProjectEvaluationStartedEventArgs`
+    * On worker node this is received from `RequestBuilder.BuildProject`
+* `BuildCheckManager` calls Configuration module and gets information for all analyzers in it's registry
+    * Analyzers with issues in configuration (communicated via `BuildCheckConfigurationException`) will issue an error and then be deregistered for the rest of the build.
+    * Global configuration issue (communicated via `BuildCheckConfigurationException`) will issue an error and then entirely disable BuildCheck.
+* `BuildCheckManager` instantiates all newly enabled analyzers and updates configuration for all already instantiated analyzers.
+* At that point of time analyzers are prepared for receiving data and performing their work. MSBuild will start calling `BuildCheckManager` callbacks (mostly pumping `BuildEventArgs`), passed data will be translated into BuildCheck OM and passed to analyzers.
+* Analyzers may decide to report results of their findings (via `BuildCheckDataContext.ReportResult`), the infrastructure will then perform post-processing (filter out reports for `Rule`s that are disabled, set the severity based on configuration) and send the result via the standard MSBuild logging infrastructure.
+* Analysis result might hence be reported after project's final `ProjectFinishedEventArgs`
+* Final status of the build should not be reported (and `BuildFinishedEventArgs` logged) until all analyzers are done processing and their results are accounted for.

+# Threat model of MSBuild BuildCheck feature
+
+## BuildCheck Feature Description
+
+The infrastructure within MSBuild allowing pluggability and execution of
+Analyzers and their Rules previously known as "warning waves" and
+"MSBuild Analyzers".
+
+The feature is meant to help customers to improve and understand quality of their MSBuild scripts via rules violations reporting. It will allow MSBuild to gradually roll out additional rules, as users will be capable to configure their opt-in and severity of reports – preventing unwanted build breakages. And to equip powerusers to roll out their own quality checks – whether for general community or internal enterprise usage.
+
+[Design
+Spec](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/proposed/BuildCheck.md)
+
+[Architecture](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/specs/proposed/BuildCheck-Architecture.md)
+
+# Threats Identification
+
+This feature does not alter existing nor create any new trust boundaries.
+
+It is assumed to rely on only trusted sources, be managed by trusted operators, and operated on trusted machines.
+
+For this document, we do not address any threats that result from violating these conditions.
+
+## Acquisition
+
+### Threat: Supply chain attack on custom analyzer
+
+Custom BuildCheck analyzers are executed during build. If bad external actors inject malicious code into it by supply chain attack or somehow else, such code can run on build machine, mostly build agent or develop box.
+
+#### Mitigation
+
+Custom analyzers are delivered as regular nuget packages by MSBuild `<PackageReference />` element. This way custom analyzer packages will be included in the generated SBOM and Component Government can detect and warn about known malicious custom analyzers.
+
+It is identical to Roslyn analyzers or any other nuget package, for that matter.
+
+## Execution
+
+### Threat: Supply chain attack by custom analyzer
+
+Custom BuildCheck analyzers are executed during build. If bad external actors inject malicious code into it by supply chain attack or somehow else, such code can run on build machine, mostly build agent or develop box, with intent to inject malicious behavior into build artifacts.
+
+#### Mitigation
+
+Identical to mitigation of threat [Supply chain attack on custom analyzer](#threat-supply-chain-attack-on-custom-analyzer).
+
+### Threat: Third-Party Vulnerabilities
+Vulnerabilities in custom analyzer or its dependencies.
+
+#### Mitigation
+
+Custom analyzers are delivered as regular NuGet packages by MSBuild `<PackageReference />` element. This way custom analyzer packages will be included in the generated SBOM and Component Government can detect and warn about known malicious custom analyzers.
+
+## Configuration
+
+### Threat: Malicious configuration value
+
+Although .editorconfig shall be part of trusted sources, and hence not malicious, .editorconfig is looked up in parent folders up to the root. This can allow attacked to store malicious editor config up in parent folders with intent of disabling an analyzer or cause build malfunction for any reason.
+
+#### Mitigation
+
+This problem is identical to existing .editorconfig for Roslyn analyzers and since we share code for parsing it, we adopt same mitigation strategy, which is:
+
+- default template for editor config has `root = true` stopping parent config traversing
+- code is unit tested to verify and sanitize .editorconfig values
+
+### Threat: Intentional analyzer ID conflict or misleading ID
+
+Malicious actors can define analyzer ID to be identical or like existing well known analyzer ID to increase probability of executing malicious analyzer code.
+
+#### Mitigation
+
+Main mitigation relays on nuget packages component governance.
+
+BuildCheck also disallow duplicated analyzer IDs and do not allow well known prefixes, for example `microsoft-\*`, in custom analyzers.
+
+## Declaration
+
+### Threat: Malicious analyzer registration property function
+
+Threat actor can write malicious analyzer registration property function in project files, with intent to run code from non-governed assemblies.
+
+#### Mitigation
+
+This threat is out of scope of this document, as this requires malicious modification of source code (repository) making these sources untrusted.
+
+It is mentioned here, as a note that we have thought about it.

+# BuildCheck - Design Spec
+
+Previously known as "warning waves" and "MSBuild Analyzers"
+
+The feature is meant to help customers to improve and understand quality of their MSBuild scripts via rules violations reporting. It will allow MSBuild to gradually roll out additional rules, as users will be capable to configure their opt-in and severity of reports – preventing unwanted build breakages. And to equip powerusers to roll out their own quality checks – whether for general community or internal enterprise usage.
+
+# Terminology
+
+* **Analyzer** – unit of execution (single implementing class), can host multiple rules. 
+* **Rule** – Single violation type, with single unique code (`“BC1234: Redefining built-in target”`). 
+* **Report** – Output from Analyzer informing about violating particular rule.
+* **CodeFix** – Violation remedy suggestion. Not yet applicable for MSBuild.
+* **BuildCheck** - Feature name. The infrastructure within MSBuild allowing pluggability and execution of Analyzers and their Rules
+
+
+# North Star / Longer-term vision
+
+MSBuild provides a rich object model (further just OM) exposing representation of the build scripts (unstructured and structured model of documents contributing to the build), build data (the definition and evaluated values of MSBuild primitives) and build execution (the eventing model of inputs, processing and outputs of the orchestrated execution) so that various quality checking rules can be authored. This includes static analysis rules (e.g. checking validity of condition expressions) as well as build execution rules (e.g. checking of referencing nonexistent files) and composition rules (e.g. unintended outputs overwrites checking). Identical OM is exposed from live build execution and via post-build log event sourcing – so that users can choose whether the build analysis will happen as part of the build or as a separate process.
+
+Users are able to tune the behavior of the checks via `.editorconfig` which brings unified and standardized experience with other tooling (including built-in and third-party C# analyzers) leveraging `.editorconfig` files.
+
+Powerusers are able to develop, test and publish their custom analyzers easily and contribute them back to community. The local development scenario doesn’t require roundtrip through packaging.
+
+A solid set of in-the-box analyzers is provided by MSBuild and the .NET SDK, extended each release, with high quality reports (pointing exact locations of issue, offering clear and actionable explanations, not repetitive for builds with multi-execution or/and multi-importing of a same script in single build context). The existing in-the-box analyzers are gradually enabled by default and their severity increased - in waves (likely tied to sdk releases) - aiming to constantly increase quality of our customers build scripts. MSBuild.exe (and hence Visual Studio) builds will take more conservative approach with requiring an explicit opt-in into the analyzers - in order to not introduce upgrade blockers. 
+
+The analysis has small impact on build duration with ability to disable analysis altogether which will remove all the performance costs associated with the analysis. The perf impact on representative projects is continuously monitored and documented by the MsBuild team.
+
+
+# Scope of initial iteration
+
+Majority of following cases are included in appropriate context within the scenarios in [User Experience](#user-experience) section. Following is a quick overview.
+
+## In scope
+* Inbox (built-in) analyzers that run during the build execution.
+* Inbox analyzers that run when replaying binlog.
+* Custom authored analyzers, delivered via nuget.
+* Analyzers reports (errors, warnings, messages) are in logger output, VS error window.
+* Codes will be distinguishable from standard build warnings/error (to prevent easy mixups and attempts to configure standard msbuild warnings/errors via editorconfig), but otherwise the outputs are very similar.
+* Default opt-ins and levels for inbox analyzers set by sdk version (via [`$SdkAnalysisLevel`]((https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/proposed/sdk-analysis-level.md))) or other agreed mechanism for controlling increasing strictness between .NET versions.
+* Custom analyzers opted in via `PackageReference` of a particular nuget with the analyzer.
+* Explicit overrides of enablement and analysis levels via `.editorconfig` file (with up to a per-project scope).
+* [Specification of `.editorconfig`](https://spec.editorconfig.org/) will be observed. 
+* Simplified authoring experience via template and doc.
+* Single analyzer can produce reports for multiple rules. However those need to be declared upfront.
+* Opt-in reporting of time spent via specific analyzers and infra overall.
+* Collect touched `.editorconfig`s into binlog embedded files.
+* Possibility to opt-out from analysis - the perf should not be impacted when done so.
+* Team collects performance impact numbers on a set of benchmark builds with the inbox analyzers enabled.
+
+## Non Goals, but subject for consideration
+* Custom analyzer in a local project (source codes) or a binary.
+* Bulk configuration of multiple rules (based on prefixes).
+* Specifying scope of MSBuild imports that will be considered for analysis (so that e.g. data from sdk won't even be passed to analyzer, if not requested).
+* Attempts to try to configure standard msbuild warnings/errors via `.editorconfig` should lead to fail fast errors.
+* Configuring analysis levels when analyzing from binlog - beyond the collected editorconfigs
+* Structured information in VS error window (similarly to the Roslyn analyzer reports - reports have titles, details, locations, searchable codes and exposed links leading to detailed documentation).
+
+
+## Out of scope
+* Instrumentation for telemetry.
+* Design time build analysis.
+* Localization support (for reports message formats, identifiers, etc.).
+* Custom analyzers have equal data access as the inbox analyzers. We'll aim to ship analyzers that use public BuildCheck API/OM surface. But for extra agility we might chose to implement and ship some analyzers using unexposed data.
+* All inbox analyzers reports have precise location(s) of issues (however for each individual analyzer not providing precise location we should have a very strong reason, why location cannot be provided and why it still brings value even without precise location).
+* Opt-out of analysis on code-level (something like C# `#pragma warning disable`, but within msbuild xml files).
+* Simplified authoring experience via dedicated reference assembly.
+* Restore phase analysis.
+* Turning analysis off/on based on target (e.g. multi-targeted builds, calling MSBuild task etc.).
+* Controlling/Configuring lifetime of analyzers - analyzers will currently be held alive, as single instance per analyzer, for the whole duration of the build. But future versions might prevent some of the analyzers to survive beyond a scope of a single project built (means for sharing data would be provided).
+* Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) for analyzers.
+* Attributing `.editorconfig` configurations to .sln files. E.g.:
+```ini
+# I expect this to apply to all projects within my solution, but not to projects which are not part of the solution
+[ContosoFrontEnd.sln]
+build_check.BC0101.IsEnabled=true
+build_check.BC0101.Severity=warning
+```
+* Attributing `.editorconfig` configurations to lower granularity than whole projects. E.g.:
+```ini
+# I expect this to apply only to a scope of the imported file. Or possibly I expect this to apply to all projects importing this project.
+[ContosoCommonImport.proj]
+buildcheck.BC0101.IsEnabled=true
+buildcheck.BC0101.Severity=warning
+```
+* Respecting `.editorconfig` file in msbuild import locations (unless they are in the parent folders hierarchy of particular project file).
+* CodeFixes are not supported in V1
+ 
+
+# User Experience
+
+## Running / UX
+
+### Inbox Analyzers
+
+Suggested list of analyzers to be shipped with V1: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9630#issuecomment-2007440323
+
+The proposed initial configuration for those is TBD (as well based on initial test runs of the analyzers of chosen public repositories).
+
+### Live Build
+
+BuildCheck will run as part of the build and execute [inbox analyzers](#inbox-analyzers) and [custom analyzers](#acquisition-of-custom-analyzers) based on the [configuration](#configuration). Users will have an option to completely opt-out from BuildCheck to run via commandline switch.
+
+Findings - reports - of analyzers will be output as build messages/warnings/errors, and the message/warnings/error code should help distinguish BuildCheck produced reports from regular build errors/warnings.
+
+BuildCheck reports will have power to fail the build (via errors or warnings), that would otherwise succeed without the BuildCheck. This is actually the main benefit of the feature - as it helps enforcing new rules, that are easily user configurable individually or as a whole feature - to prevent unwanted breakages of legacy builds not ready for improvements.
+
+### Binlog Replay mode
+
+Users will have option to explicitly opt-in to run BuildCheck during the binlog replay mode:
+
+```bash
+> dotnet build msbuild.binlog /analyze
+```
+
+Would there be any analyzers that are not possible to run during the replay mode (subject to internal design - this difference won't be exposed during [custom analyzers authoring](#custom-analyzers-authoring)), replay mode will inform user about those via warnings.
+
+Replay mode will by default consider `.editorconfig` files stored within the binlog and will run analyzers based on those. This would possibly lead to unintended double-reports – as binlog will have the runtime analysis reports stored, plus the replay-time analysis reports will be augmented. At the same time we might want to run some additional checks in the replay mode, that have not been enabled (or not even available) during the build time.
+
+For this reason we will consider following modes (all are non-goals):
+* All binlog stored reports are skipped by default. We add option to request not skipping them (but they might need to be prefixed or otherwise distinguished from the 'fresh' reports).
+* Ability to specify skipping of the stored .editorconfig files
+* Ability to specify single replay-time .editorconfig file and it’s precedence (only the specified, specified as most significant, specified as least significant)
+
+We might as well consider specifying custom analyzers on a command line (as a non-goal) - so that unreferenced custom analyzers can be run against the binlog.
+
+## Configuration
+
+There will be 3 mechanisms of configuring the analyzers and rules:
+* The default configuration declared by the analyzers themselves ([more details on implementation](#rules-declaration))
+* [Sdk Analysis Level property](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/proposed/sdk-analysis-level.md) – mostly for the inbox analyzers
+* `.editorconfig` file
+
+For the `.editorconfig` file configuration, following will apply:
+* Only `.editorconfig` files collocated with the project file or up the folder hierarchy will be considered.
+* `.editorconfig` files placed along with explicitly or implicitly imported msbuild files won’t be considered.
+* `.editorconfig` files packaged within nuget packages within local nuget cache won’t be considered.
+
+### Non-Goals (but might be considered):
+* bulk configuration of multiple rules - based on analyzers/rules prefixes or/and categories.
+* attempts to try to configure standard msbuild warnings/errors via `.editorconfig` should lead to fail fast errors.
+* configuring analysis levels when analyzing from binlog - beyond the collected editorconfigs.
+* Aliasing the analyzers/rules, allowing to create multiple instances with different custom configuration (e.g. single analyzer checking configurable list of forbidden properties prefixes can have 2 instance, each initialized with different list to check, each of the instance configurable for individual projects separately).
+
+### Out of scope for configuration:
+* opt-out of analysis on code-level (analogy to C# pragmas, but within msbuild xml files).
+* lower granularity of `.editorconfig` settings other than whole projects.
+* attributing configuration to a .sln file and expecting it will apply to all contained projects.
+* Support for multiple [custom configurations](#custom-configuration-declaration) within a single build for a single rule. (Not to be mixed with [standardized configuration](#standardized-configuration-declaration) - which can be configured freely per project) If a custom configuration will be used, it will need to be specified identically in each explicit configurations of the rule. This is chosen so that there are no implicit requirements on lifetime of the analyzer or analyzer instancing – each analyzer will be instantiated only once per build (this is however something that will very likely change in future versions – so authors are advised not to take hard dependency on single instance policy).
+
+### Sample configuration
+
+```ini
+[*.csproj]
+build_check.BC0101.Severity=warning
+
+build_check.COND0543.Severity=none
+build_check.COND0543.EvaluationAnalysisScope=AnalyzedProjectOnly
+build_check.COND0543.CustomSwitch=QWERTY
+```
+
+### User Configurable Options
+
+Initial version of BuildCheck plans a limited set of options configurable by user (via `.editorconfig`) by which users can override default configuration of individual analyzer rules.
+
+**NOTE:** The actual naming of the configuration options is yet to be determined.
+
+#### Severity
+
+Option `Severity` with following values will be available:
+
+* `Default`
+* `None`
+* `Suggestion`
+* `Warning`
+* `Error`
+
+Severity levels are in line with [roslyn analyzers severity levels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/use-roslyn-analyzers). `Default` severity in `.editorconfig` will lead to using build-in severity from the analyzer (so this can be used for clearing custom severity setting from higher level `.editorconfig` file). `Default` severity in the build-in code has same effect as if the code doesn't specify severity at all - an infrastruture default of `None` is considered.
+
+Configuration will dictate transformation of the analyzer report to particular build output type (message, warning or error).
+
+Each rule has a severity, even if multiple rules are defined in a single analyzer. The rule can have different severities for different projects within a single build session.
+
+If all the rules from a single analyzer have severity `None` - analyzer won't be given any data for such configured part of the build (specific project or a whole build). If analyzer have some rules enabled and some disabled - it will be still fed with data, but the reports will be post-filtered.
+
+#### Scope of Analysis
+
+Option `EvaluationAnalysisScope` with following possible options will be available:
+* `ProjectOnly` - Only the data from currently analyzed project will be sent to the analyzer. Imports will be discarded.
+* `ProjectWithImportsFromCurrentWorkTree` - Only the data from currently analyzed project and imports from files under the entry project or solution will be sent to the analyzer. Other imports will be discarded.
+* `ProjectWithImportsWithoutSdks` - Imports from SDKs will not be sent to the analyzer. Other imports will be sent.
+* `ProjectWithAllImports` - All data will be sent to the analyzer.
+
+All rules of a single analyzer must have the `EvaluationAnalysisScope` configured to a same value. If any rule from the analyzer have the value configured differently - a warning will be issued during the build and analyzer will be deregistered.
+
+Same rule can have `EvaluationAnalysisScope` configured to different values for different projects.
+
+BuildCheck might not be able to guarantee to properly filter the data with this distinction for all [registration types](#RegisterActions) - in case an explicit value is attempted to be configured (either [from the analyzer code](#BuildAnalyzerConfiguration) or from `.editorconfig` file) for an analyzer that has a subscription to unfilterable data - a warning will be issued during the build and analyzer will be deregistered.
+
+
+## Analyzers and Rules Identification
+
+**TBD**
+
+* Recommended and reserved prefixes
+* Short vs descriptive names
+* Rules categories
+* Ability to use prefixes during configuration
+
+
+## Custom Analyzers Authoring
+
+### Implementation
+
+To author custom analyzer, user will need to implement given contract (delivered in Microsoft.Build package). The contract will provide access to the exposed BuildCheck OM focused on build analysis.
+
+#### Analyzer declaration
+
+Simplified proposal:
+
+```csharp
+public abstract class BuildAnalyzer : IDisposable
+{
+    /// <summary>
+    /// Friendly name of the analyzer.
+    /// Should be unique - as it will be used in the tracing stats, infrastructure error messages, etc.
+    /// </summary>
+    public abstract string FriendlyName { get; }
+
+    /// <summary>
+    /// Single or multiple rules supported by the analyzer.
+    /// </summary>
+    public abstract IReadOnlyList<BuildAnalyzerRule> SupportedRules { get; }
+
+    /// <summary>
+    /// Optional initialization of the analyzer.
+    /// </summary>
+    /// <param name="configurationContext">
+    /// Custom data (not recognized by the infrastructure) passed from .editorconfig
+    /// Currently the custom data has to be identical for all rules in the analyzer and all projects.
+    /// </param>
+    public abstract void Initialize(ConfigurationContext configurationContext);
+
+    /// <summary>
+    /// 
+    /// </summary>
+    /// <param name="context"></param>
+    public abstract void RegisterActions(IBuildCheckRegistrationContext context);
+
+    public virtual void Dispose()
+    { }
+}
+```
+
+<a name="RegisterActions"></a>The context in `RegisterActions` call will enable subscriptions for data pumping from the infrastructure. 
+
+Sample of how registrations might look like:
+
+```csharp
+public interface IBuildCheckRegistrationContext
+{
+    void RegisterEvaluatedPropertiesAction(Action<BuildCheckDataContext<EvaluatedPropertiesAnalysisData>> evaluatedPropertiesAction);
+
+    void RegisterParsedItemsAction(Action<BuildCheckDataContext<ParsedItemsAnalysisData>> parsedItemsAction);
+
+    // ...
+}
+```
+
+The data provided in callbacks for registered actions will allow the analyzer to submit reports for its rules. A single callback can lead to multiple reports being generated.
+
+Any analyzer will be allowed to produce reports only for Rules that it declared in it’s `SupportedRules` definition.
+
+#### Rules declaration
+
+A single analyzer can declare support of multiple rules – since it might produce reports for those on top of same input data – and for efficiency reasons a single processing of data might be needed.
+
+Simplified proposal of definition of a single rule:
+
+```csharp
+public class BuildAnalyzerRule
+{
+    // Identification/Description fields
+    // (To be defined more precisely by https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/9823)
+
+    /// <summary>
+    /// The default configuration - overridable by the user via .editorconfig.
+    /// If no user specified configuration is provided, this default will be used.
+    /// </summary>
+    public BuildAnalyzerConfiguration DefaultConfiguration { get; }
+}
+```
+
+<a name="BuildAnalyzerConfiguration"></a>Each rule will supply its default configuration (mainly enablement and report severity) – those will apply if `.editorconfig` file will not set those settings explicitly. If the rule doesn't provide (some of) its defaults, a global hardcoded default is used (`severity: message, enabled: false`).
+
+#### Standardized configuration declaration
+
+Proposal of configuration specification:
+
+```csharp
+/// <summary>
+/// Configuration for a build analyzer.
+/// Default values can be specified by the Analyzer in code.
+/// Users can overwrite the defaults by explicit settings in the .editorconfig file.
+/// Each rule can have its own configuration, which can differ per each project.
+/// The <see cref="EvaluationAnalysisScope"/> setting must be same for all rules in the same analyzer (but can differ between projects)
+/// </summary>
+public class BuildAnalyzerConfiguration
+{
+    /// <summary>
+    /// This applies only to specific events, that can distinguish whether they are directly inferred from
+    ///  the current project, or from some import. If supported it can help tuning the level of detail or noise from analysis.
+    ///
+    /// If not supported by the data source - then the setting is ignored
+    /// </summary>
+    public EvaluationAnalysisScope? EvaluationAnalysisScope { get; internal init; }
+
+    /// <summary>
+    /// The default severity of the result for the rule. May be overridden by user configuration.
+    ///
+    /// If all rules within the analyzer are `none`, the whole analyzer will not be run.
+    /// If some rules are `none` and some are not, the analyzer will be run and reports will be post-filtered.
+    /// </summary>
+    public BuildAnalyzerResultSeverity? Severity { get; internal init; }
+}
+```
+
+Values for this recognized contract, that are explicitly specified via .editorconfig files are passed only to the BuildCheck infrastructure – they are invisible to the actual analyzers (NOTE: this is a subject to likely revision).
+
+#### Custom configuration declaration
+
+However if user will specify additional – unrecognized - values in `.editorconfig` file as part of a particular analyzer configuration – those values will be extracted as key-value pairs and passed to the analyzer initialization call (`Initialize`) via `ConfigurationContext`:
+
+```csharp
+/// <summary>
+/// Holder of an optional configuration from .editorconfig file (not recognized by the infrastructure)
+/// </summary>
+public class ConfigurationContext
+{
+    /// <summary>
+    /// Custom configuration data - per each rule that has some specified.
+    /// </summary>
+    public CustomConfigurationData[] CustomConfigurationData { get; init; }
+}
+```
+
+This can allow creation of extendable checks – e.g. a check that will validate that properties defined within project do not start with any forbidden prefix, while actual prefixes to check are configurable – so the user of the check can tune the behavior to their needs.
+
+More details on configuration are in [Configuration](#configuration) section.
+
+
+#### Compatibility
+
+All the publicly exposed contracts will be available within `Microsoft.Build.Experimental.BuildCheck` namespace. The namespace is expressing that contracts are not guaranteed to be backward compatible (however breakage will be limited to necessary cases). The availability of particular set of BuildCheck API will be queryable via [Feature Query API](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/pull/9665):
+
+```csharp
+var availability = Features.CheckFeatureAvailability("BuildCheck.Beta");
+```
+
+This way the analyzers authors will be equipped to write highly-compatible analyzers even in a possibility of changing API.
+
+
+### Testing and Debugging
+
+**TBD**
+
+We aim to provide ability to locally test analyzers from local projects or assemblies without a need to roundtrip through packaging them. The exact way is yet to be determined.
+
+At the same time we aim to provide mocks providing the BuildCheck context data – this work is however a non-goal.
+
+### Packaging
+
+Several requirements are mandated for analyzer packages to be properly recognized (Netstandard only, A call to designated property function will need to be part of the packaged build assets, dependencies will need to be packaged, binaries structure flattened). There might as well be couple of optional practices making the analyzer package more resources savvy (E.g. defining the rule ids and enablement status within the mentioned property function - so that such information doesn't require loading and calling of the analyzer type).
+
+Also custom analyzer package is a dependency is a purely development time harness - so it should be marked as [`DevelopmentDependency`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#developmentdependency).
+
+In order to simplify the packaging process (and meeting above mentioned requirements) a dotnet template will be provided producing proper package on pack action.
+
+**TBD** - dotnet new sample on initiating the development.
+
+## Acquisition of custom analyzers
+
+Apart from [inbox analyzers](#inbox-analyzers) (shipped together with msbuild), users will be able to plug-in packaged analyzers shipped as nugets (this will serve for community contributions, but possibly as a venue for off-cycle distribution of official analyzers).
+
+In order to use an analyzer package users just need to reference them via `<PackageReference>` element as standard package reference. 
+
+```xml
+<PackageReference Include="Contoso.Analyzers" Version="1.2.3" />
+```
+
+Only projects referencing the package will be able to run its analyzers. Enabling the rules from package on other projects won’t take any effect.

+# What is Feature Availablity?
+Feature Availability is an API that can tell you the availability status of the specific feature of the MSBuild engine. Feature names are represented by strings and availability is an enum `FeatureStatus` with the following values:
+*  `Undefined` - the availability of the feature is undefined (the feature might or might not be supported by the current MSBuild engine - the feature is unknown to the feature availability checker, so it cannot be decided).
+*  `Available` - the feature is available
+*  `NotAvailable` - the feature is not available (unlike `Undefined`, the feature name is known to the feature availability checker and it knows the feature is not supported by current MSBuild engine)
+*  `Preview` - the feature is in preview (not stable)
+
+# How to use?
+## API
+In `Microsoft.Build.Framework` use `FeatureStatus Features.CheckFeatureAvailability(string featureName)` to get the feature availability.
+
+## Command line switch
+Use `/featureavailability`(`-featureavailability`) or `/fa` (`-fa`) switches.
+
+## Property function `CheckFeatureAvailability`
+Use `string CheckFeatureAvailability(string featureName)` property function.
+```xml
+<PropertyGroup>
+  <FeatureAvailability>$([MSBuild]::CheckFeatureAvailability('FeatureA'))</FeatureAvailability>
