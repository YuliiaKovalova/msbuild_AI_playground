 # Acquisition
 
-**TBD** - implementation details to be amended by @YuliiaKovalova
+BuildCheck employs two distinct types of analyzers: inbox and custom. As a result, the acquisition and distribution processes vary.
+Inbox rules are integrated into the MSBuild repository, while custom analyzers can be packaged as NuGet packages and detected by MSBuild provided they adhere to a specific structure. 
 
+To streamline the creation of custom rules, a special [template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates) has been introduced.
+To enable MSBuild to recognize a custom analyzer, it must invoke the intrinsic function `void RegisterAnalyzer(string path)`, which requires the path to the assembly as input. Therefore, it's essential for the user to ensure that the assembly exists in the specified location.
+Additionally, the custom rule must use [BuildAnalyzerRule.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/9cdb3615adb4115f92b390de2f258fac5f320909/src/Build/BuildCheck/API/BuildAnalyzerRule.cs#L11C14-L11C31) as a parent class; otherwise, the system will not register it.

+**The link to example rule has to be here with some explanations**
