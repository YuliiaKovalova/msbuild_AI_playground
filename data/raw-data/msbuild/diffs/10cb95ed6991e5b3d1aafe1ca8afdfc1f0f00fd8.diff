 If BuildCheck is enabled, then the events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource` and new events from BuildCheck are merged into the `IEventSource`, from which the loggers get events.

 1. The events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource replayEventSource` are passed to the `IEventSource mergedEventSource` unchanged.
 2. The events from `BinaryLogReplayEventSource replayEventSource` are passed to `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler` in order to produce new events from BuildCheck.
 3. The `BuildCheckBuildEventHandler` uses the `IEventSource mergedEventSource` to invoke new events.
