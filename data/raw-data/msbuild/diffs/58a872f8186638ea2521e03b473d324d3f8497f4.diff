+MSBuild binary logs are then captured to a location specified via `MSBUILDDEBUGPATH` environment variable (or defaults to `MSBuild_Logs` subfolder of a current folder or `%temp%`, based on access rights).
 
 âš  NOTE: logs are being recorded for each MSBuild invocation (including design time builds) and kept in the folder without removing older ones - so the number of log files can grow quickly. It is recommended to set the opt-in environment variable only for the short duration of reproducing the issue to be investigated (though it is understandable that some nondeterministic issues might need multiple reproduction attempts)
