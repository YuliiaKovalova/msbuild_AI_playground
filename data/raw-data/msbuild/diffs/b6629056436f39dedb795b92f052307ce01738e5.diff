+# MSBuild Telemetry
+
+MSBuild emits and collects telemetry to guide decisions on modernization and optimization investments. Currently the MSBuild collects telemetry only when run from SDK host (mostly the `dotnet build` and `dotnet msbuild` commands). For more details please refer to [the official SDK telemetry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry).
+
+Visual Studio collects some build related telemetry (TODO: link the specific info here) - but that is not leveraging any MSBuild instrumentation, but rather information about count and duration of MSBuild API invocations from the caller point of view.
+
+## Type of data collected
+
+To tailor modernization and performance optimization investments we need to contain *anonymized* **Usage Data**. Those reflect type of features being used and execution time being spent in them.
+
+## Opting out
+
+MSBuild telemetry collection (that is turned on by default), can be opted out - same as .NET SDK telemetry in general - via setting `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `1` or `true`.
+
+## Datapoints overview
+
+### Logging Configuration
+
+Expressed and collected via [LoggingConfigurationTelemetry type](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/94941d9cb26bb86045452b4a174a357b65a30c99/src/Framework/Telemetry/LoggingConfigurationTelemetry.cs)
