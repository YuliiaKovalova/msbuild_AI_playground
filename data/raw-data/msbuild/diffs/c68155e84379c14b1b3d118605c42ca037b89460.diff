-It is inspired by the golang modules functioning - where a standalone dependency has a pointer to it's source location as a first-class citizen within the ecosystem (go.mod) and the relation between the source code and runtime dependecy is unambigously guaranteed by the compiler.

  ## Possible Implementations
 
+ ### Opting-in
+
+ For simplified and isolated rollout of this feature we propose CLI-only interface (no VS or other tooling integration):
+
+```cmd
+> dotnet tool install Microsoft.Build.PackageSourcing
+> dotnet package-to-sources --project MySolution.sln --packages: FooBar.Baz, Newtonsoft.Json
+
+FooBar.Baz:
+Sources located: github.com/FooBar/Baz@0abcb66
+Local checkout: C:\Users\jankrivanek\.nuget\sources\FooBar\6.5.4\
+Build recipe created: FooBar-package-sourcing.proj
+Build reconstructed: OK
+Reference replaced: OK
+
+Newtonsoft.Json:
+...
+
+Sourced packages are ready to use.
+
+>
+```
+
+This as well solves the question of preserving the info about packages sourcing.
+
+### Opting-out
+
+This can be achieved via adding a metadata to mofdified MSBuild files, storing the info about original `PackageReference`s and then reverting those via another CLI command:
+
+```cmd
+> dotnet package-to-sources --revert --project MySolution.sln --packages: FooBar.Baz, Newtonsoft.Json
+
+Successfuly reverted packages sourcing for: FooBar.Baz, Newtonsoft.Json.
+>
+```
+
+### Local storage of sources
+
+To be decided (nuget cache? Submodules of the current git context? ...)
+
  ### Locating proper sources
  * Most preferable way is via `SourceLink` metadata within the nuget package itself ([documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/sourcelink), [reading the metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-client-sdk#get-package-metadata))
  * Fallback to `SourceLink` metadata within symbol files ([documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/sourcelink?view=msvc-170), [Portable PDB format spec](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/specs/PortablePdb-Metadata.md), [reading source locations metadata](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Reflection.Metadata/tests/Metadata/PortablePdb/DocumentNameTests.cs))
  * We should consider ability to specify/pass-in a custom location of sources - this would facilitate portion of the 'Source as package reference' scenario (possibly something that might be usable for our 'source build' or 'VMR build').
 
  ### Infering the 'build recipe'
- This is the most challenging part of the story - as .NET ecosystem currently doesn't enforce custom build pre-requisities standards nor conventions and hence it is not possible to replicate the package build process without possible manual steps. This part will hence be 'best efforts' with sensible communication of issues to user.
- * Option A: Sources crawling and finding project by name/assembly name; build; compare results
- * Option B: Working backwards from the nuget (finding pack script or msbuild properties indicating nuget creation ...); build; compare results
- * Option C: Using Roslyn to extract information from PE and reconstruct the compilation ([experimental code](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Compilers/Core/Rebuild/CompilationFactory.cs#L45))

+ * Option C: Working backwards from the nuget (finding pack script or msbuild properties indicating nuget creation ...); build; compare results
+ * Option D: Seting up convention for explicit description of build prerequisites and package build. Inspiration for this can be `.proj` files describing external dependencies build recipe in dotnet source build ([sample build descriptions](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-externals/tree/main/repos))
 
 **_Extensive research needed for this subproblem._**
 
  ### Verifying identity of local package with the feed one
 
  In case deterministic build was opted-out, this would be very challenging and nearly impossible - so not supported.
- For signed assemblies we'll need to strip signatures ([`ImageRemoveCertificate`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/imagehlp/nf-imagehlp-imageremovecertificate)). Removing signature might nullify checksum bytes in PE header - so binary comparison to the locally built assembly might not match (solution is to temporarily remove the PE header checksum from the local binary as well - to facilitate binary equality).

+ To be decided.
+ But likely this will be no-op for the initial version - standard usage scenarios for project references will kick in.
