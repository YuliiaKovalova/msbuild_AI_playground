  This is the most challenging part of the story - as .NET ecosystem currently doesn't enforce custom build pre-requisities standards nor conventions and hence it is not possible to replicate the package build process without possible manual steps. This part will hence be 'best efforts' with sensible communication of issues to user. 
  
  We envision multiple options to achieve this goal (with possibility of fallback/combination of multiple approaches):
- * Option A: Using Pdb info/ Roslyn to extract information from PE/Pdbs and reconstruct the compilation ([roslyn experimental code](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Tools/BuildValidator/Program.cs#L268), [NugetPackageExplorer SymbolValidator](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer/blob/main/Core/SymbolValidation/SymbolValidator.cs#L145)). Access to symbol files (whether published as .snupkg on nuget.org or on microsoft or corporate symbols servers) is crucial for this method. As well as usage of particualr compiler toolchain used to generate the inspected package ([sdk 5.0.3 or MSBuild 16.10](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer/commit/a272c8c314257dfa99c6befd2cfeff39b8a6ecbe)). Prototyping task: #8511
- * Option B: Attempt to run build (`dotnet build`) on `.sln` in repo root or `src` folder, or fallback to discovery of most common build scripts in repo root (`build.<extension>` for few most common script types based on current OS). Prototyping task: #8512

  * Option C: Sources crawling and finding project by name/assembly name; build; compare results.
  * Option D: Working backwards from the nuget (finding pack script or msbuild properties indicating nuget creation ...); build; compare results
  * Option E: Seting up convention for explicit description of build prerequisites and package build. Inspiration for this can be `.proj` files describing external dependencies build recipe in dotnet source build ([sample build descriptions](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-externals/tree/main/repos)) or [`git dependencies`](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/git-dependencies.html) project for Paket

   * The `Option B` might not have acceptable success rate - it is still very appealing option if combined with other approach. 
 
- * Discrepancies between the `PackageReference` and `ProjectReference` configurability and behavior (different metadata support, different behavior for some of the same metadata, different layout of the the bin outputs yielding some assumptions breaks, nuget support for packaged props/targets, etc.)
+ * Discrepancies between the `PackageReference` and `ProjectReference` configurability and behavior (different metadata support, different behavior for some of the same metadata, different layout of the the bin outputs yielding some assumptions breaks, nuget support for packaged props/targets, etc.). Probably the biggest problem will be the usage of build features - build.props and build.targets (as those are placed during the project build, but couldn't be identicaly consumed during the same build as for the package reference)
 
     Possible solutions: 
-      * Those differences needs to be researched/catalogued and categorized first, then we can decide what to consolidate and what will not be explicitly supported. Investigation item: #8507
-      * It might be beneficial to perform analysis of usage prevalence of the individual metadata. Investigation task: #8521

+ * Running a build script on a local machine is possible security risk - user should be properly warned and informed.
+ * Verifying the binary identity might add unnecesary high cost to the operation at unwanted time - the rebuild is likely needed only after user want to make a change. But the verification might stll be agood idea - especially for cases where we attempt to run a build script (and we might e.g. be running `build.sh` due to being on Unix, while official nuget was published from Windows build).
+ 
+   Possible solution: We might hold on until user makes a change and wants to test run it (we can then compare it with the version that was originaly downloaded - to perform a build verifying the binary identity of the original nuget binary and local reconstructed binary). In the ideal case the experience would be very seamless - user steps into the code during debugging (or via decompilation) and is allowed to perform change - if they perform change they are first asked to confirm that action and to acknowledge this will lead to running the component build on their machine. The current environment might even decide which of the build reconstruction techniques will be fastest based on the change the user made (e.g. single code file vs change to .resx etc.)
+
+ * Building the package on different SDK might lead to slightly different results - this we'll likely need to accept as limitation
+ * Global properties propagate nto the `ProjectReference`, wherease `PackageReference` is already built (example: `Debug` configuration can get propagated into `ProjectReference`, while the consumed `PackageReference` was build in `Release` mode).

+    Possible solution: Add 'Remove All Global Properties' feature for a project build.
