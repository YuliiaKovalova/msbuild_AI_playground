 ## At release time
 Before starting the process:
-- [ ] If the release is being cut more than a few days before the VS-side snap, do these two steps. Otherwise check them off.
-  - [ ]  Modify the VS insertion so that it flows from MSBuild `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` to VS `main` [in the MSBuild-release-branch release definition](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_release?definitionId=1319&view=mine&_a=releases). Alternatively, if the release being cut no more than couple of weeks, disable the scheduled releases and create releases from `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` manually until the VS-side snap: Edit -> Schedule set under Artifacts -> disable toggle

+  - [ ]  Disabling automated run of [MSBuild VS Insertion pipeline](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_build?definitionId=24295) (our {{NEXT_VERSION}} builds don't have a place to go in VS yet) is done by: Edit -> ... -> Triggers -> add a schedule on a dead branch (this overrides the YAML defined once-per-day schedule). Manual pipeline run: select as input resource the inserted "MSBuild" pipeline run on branch `vs{{THIS_RELEASE_VERSION}}` and VS TargetBranch `main`.
